Acroteriobatus annulatus,Vulnerable,"The Lesser Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus annulatus) is a small (to 140 cm total length) benthic shark-like ray endemic to southern Africa in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Oceans from central Namibia to KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It inhabits inshore waters, including estuaries, from the shoreline to a depth of 75 m. The species matures at a relatively young age of 3 years, has an annual reproductive cycle, and litters of 2â€“10 pups. The Lesser Guitarfish is taken as bycatch of trawl, commercial and recreational line, beach seine, and gillnet fisheries, and mostly discarded with post-release mortality varying by gear and likely ranging from 0â€“33%. It may be retained by some fishers, and targeted by artisanal fishers for the good quality meat and high value fins. Trend analyses of research trawl data in South African commercially fished areas estimated a population reduction of 44% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) while trend analysis of angler surveys in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area (MPA) estimated a population increase of 14% over the past three generation lengths (15 years). The reduction in research trawls is partly driven by a steep decline in catches during the early 1990s when fishing pressure in South Africa was substantially higher. Climate change likely contributed to a northeast and inshore range shift away from the research trawl grounds that may account for some of the estimated population reduction, but that also likely represents a range contraction and decline in area of occupancy for the Lesser Guitarfish. The estimated population increase in the De Hoop MPA surveys may be a reflection of the inshore range shift of the species. Overall, due to an estimated population reduction over most of its range and a substantial reduction in fishing effort in South Africa, combined with a suspected range shift due to climate change that could account for some of the estimated reduction but also likely represents a decline in area of occupancy, it is suspected that the Lesser GuitarfishÂ has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.",The Lesser Guitarfish is likely to be utilized locally for its good quality meat with the valuable fins traded internationally (Moore 2017).,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Lesser Sandshark,"Namibia, South Africa"
Acroteriobatus blochii,Least Concern,"The Bluntnose Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus blochii) is a small (to 96 cm total length) benthic shark-like ray that inhabits shallow sandy areas in the Southeast Atlantic from southern Angola to Cape Town, South Africa. This species is caught in gillnet, beach seine, and recreational line fisheries; however, much of its range is found off remote coastal areas that are not subjected to fishing pressure. Diamond mining on the Namibian coast may threaten this species' habitat to some degree. Although further research is needed on distribution, life history, population size and trends, and threats, the population trend is suspected to be stable; therefore, the Bluntnose Guitarfish is assessed as Least Concern. Species-specific monitoring of catch should be undertaken in all fisheries in the area.",This species is not known to be used or traded. It is likely to be utilized locally in some areas for meat and the fins are valuable in trade. Other members of the genus are often targeted for their fins in artisanal fisheries (Moore 2017).,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Bluntnose guitarfish,"Namibia, South Africa"
Acroteriobatus leucospilus,Endangered,"The Greyspot Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus leucospilus) is a small (to 120 cm total length) coastal ray that occurs in the Western Indian Ocean off the coasts of Madagascar and East Africa from the Eastern Cape, South Africa to Tanzania and Zanzibar in shallow subtidal areas to a depth of 100 m. This species is captured by industrial trawl and gillnet fisheries as well as artisanal fisheries. Rhinobatids are known to be susceptible to population depletion as a result of their limiting life-history characteristics and they are often targeted for the high value of their fins. Heavy artisanal fishing pressure occurs throughout the majority of this species' range, and it has been noted that guitarfishes have decreased in size due to fishing pressure in Madagascar. There may be some recovery occurring in South Africa given that fishing effort in the inshore trawl fishery has been limited since 2007. Overall, due to heavy and increasing fishing pressure, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of at least 50% over the past three generations (15 years). Therefore, the Greyspot Guitarfish is assessed as Endangered A2d. Research is required on life-history, abundance, interaction with fisheries, and population trends.","This species is sold fresh or dried and salted locally for meat. Like other guitarfishes, they are targeted in Madagascar and possibly other areas for their fins which are valuable and are exported to Asia. Individuals are often not landed in industrial fisheries and are instead transshipped at sea for subsequent transport to Asia (McVean et al. 2006, Cripps et al. 2015).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Grayspotted guitarfish,"Mozambique, South Africa"
Acroteriobatus ocellatus,Data Deficient,"The Speckled Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus ocellatus) is a small (to 81 cm total length) demersal shark-like ray that inhabits the outer continental shelf in the Southeast Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean off South Africa and Mozambique at depths of 60â€“185 m. Demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet fisheries likely capture this species, although no data are available on the level of interactions with these fisheries. This guitarfish is rare and is known from very few specimens. There are no population size estimates, and further research is needed on distribution, life history, population size and trends, and threats (in particular interactions with fisheries). Therefore, the Speckled Guitarfish is assessed as Data Deficient.","This species is likely to be utilized locally for meat and fins. Other members of the genus are often targeted for their fins in artisanal fisheries, which are valuable and traded internationally (Moore 2017).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Speckled Guitarfish,"Mozambique, South Africa"
Acroteriobatus omanensis,Data Deficient,"The Oman Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus omanensis) is a poorly-known species with a restricted distribution in inshore waters of the Sea of Oman. It has only recently (2016) been described and is known from only a handful of specimens. Its biology and ecology are unknown, but assumed to be similar to other small rhinobatids. Given the limited number of specimens it is assessed as Data Deficient. Further research and monitoring are required to understand the status of this species as it occurs in a region with relatively intense coastal fishing.","Given the rarity of this species there is no information on use and trade beyond the fact that it is known from fishery landings. However, similar to other species of guitarfish in the region, its fins and meat likely enter the international trade.",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Oman guitarfish,"Iran (Islamic Republic of), Oman, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates"
Acroteriobatus salalah,Near Threatened,"The Salalah GuitarfishÂ (Acroteriobatus salalah) is reportedly uncommon off Oman and Pakistan. Guitarfish are commonly caught in gillnet, trawl and line fisheries throughout the region, but specific threats to this species are poorly known due to the lack of information on distribution and fisheries data. Declines of several species of inshore guitarfish have been documented within the region and present levels of catches are of concern. Limited available information for this species makes assessment difficult, but it is suspected to have declined by &lt;30% across its range given the regular capture in Pakistan where fishing is intense. Furthermore, ongoing fishing is suspected to result in a future decline over the next three generation periods (2017-2032). The species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting VU A2d+3d). Further investigation of this species is required to accurately define its range, biology, extent of catches in local fisheries and levels of declines. This assessment should be revisited as soon as this is available.","Given that this species is reportedly uncommon, there is no information on use and trade beyond the fact that it is known from fishery landings.Â However, similar to other species of guitarfish in the region, its fins and meat likely enter the international trade.",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Salalah guitarfish,"Iran (Islamic Republic of), Oman, Pakistan"
Acroteriobatus variegatus,Critically Endangered,"The Stripenose Guitarfish (Acroteriobatus variegatus) is a little known guitarfish with a restricted distribution off southern India and Sri Lanka. It occurs on the continental shelf, mainly at depths of 10-40 m, although the type specimen was reportedly collected from 366 m which would be unusual for a rhinobatid. There is also some information that indicates it prefers coral reefs. It is a small guitarfish, reaching 75 cm total length, with a small litter size (mostly 1-4, occasionally up to six). The entire range of this species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure with large numbers of trawlers operating around southern India (as well as other fishing gear). Significant declines (86%) in the landings of wedgefishes and guitarfishes combined have been documented from only a short period of time (over the five years since 2002) at a landing site in Tamil Nadu. This is the equivalent of &gt;97% decline for the Stripenose Guitarfish over the the last three generation periods (15 years). This is likely to be fully representative of the species' entire range. Ongoing intense fishing pressure, as well as declines in the quality of coral reefs raise serious concerns for this species, and a future population decline is suspected over the next three generations (2017-2032). The species is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd+3cd.",The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets and also enters the international trade in dried form. Ray meat is increasing in demand and therefore prices in India are also increasing.,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Stripenose guitarfish,"India, Sri Lanka"
Acroteriobatus zanzibarensis,Near Threatened,"This is an amended version of the 2006 assessment to accommodate recent taxonomic revision of the genus Rhinobatus.This is an apparently rare coastal rhinobatid endemic to Zanzibar, Tanzania, but known only from the type specimens. It is a large species of guitarfish, reaching at least 205 cm total length. Survey work has failed to locate other individuals in and around Zanzibar, the adjacent Tanzanian coast and the wider East African region. Coastal rhinobatids are susceptible to capture in a variety of fishing gear including trawl, gillnet, line and seine net and their occurrence along inshore areas of the continental shelf makes these rays an easy target for such fisheries. Target fisheries for guitarfish currently exist in several countries particularly in the Indo-West Pacific and declines in some species have been documented. When taken, flesh is utilized and the fins of larger species (possibly including A. zanzibarensis) enter the international fin trade for the Asian market. Coastal waters of Zanzibar are consistently fished by artisanal fishers mostly using traditional vessels. A wide variety of gear is employed including drag nets, spear, handline, seine nets and fish traps. Rays are known to be caught and retained and shark fin is marketed. If A. zanzibarensis is restricted to the inshore continental shelf around Zanzibar, the majority of its available habitat would be fished by a variety of gear. Various regulations govern gear use in Zanzibar, but there are issues with enforcement and so illegal and sometimes destructive fishing activities still occur. The present level of fishing in coastal areas of Zanzibar is of concern for this large, rare and limited range guitarfish. If however, the species is found to have a wider range into deeper waters, it may presently persist due to the limited range of traditional fishing vessels. Fishing pressure outside coastal areas is minimal at present in Tanzania. Although a little known species, given its large size, rarity, and restricted range as presently known, the species is assessed as Near Threatened. There is an equal possibly that the species may no longer exist in the wild, or that remnant populations presently exist beyond the range of traditional fisheries operating around Zanzibar. Further research (including continued market and fishing surveys) is required to document habitat, distribution and to locate any remnant populations.",NA,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Zanzibar guitarfish,United Republic of Tanzania
Alopias pelagicus,Endangered,"The Pelagic Thresher (Alopias pelagicus) is a large (to 365 cm total length), wide-ranging Indo-Pacific pelagic shark that occurs from the surface to depths of 300 m. It has a low fecundity (average two pups per litter) and a very low annual rate of population increase of 0.033. The species is caught as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. The species is often retained for its meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high at-vessel mortality remains a threat even where retention is prohibited. The Pelagic Thresher is especially susceptible to fisheries exploitation because its epipelagic habitat occurs within the range of many largely unregulated and under-reported, small-scale and artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries, in which it is readily caught. The species is estimated to be declining in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Across its Indo-Pacific distribution, the Pelagic Thresher is estimated to have reduced by 50â€“79% over the last three generations (55.5 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation, and therefore the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The species is used for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin (Compagno 2001, Jabado et al. 2015).

Alopias superciliosus,Vulnerable,"The Bigeye Thresher (Alopias superciliosus) is a large (to 484 cm total length) pelagic shark, occurring worldwide in tropical and temperate seas from the surface down to depths of 955 m. It has a low fecundity (average two pups per litter) and the lowest intrinsic rebound potential of the thresher shark species. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Although intrinsically more sensitive to over-exploitation, the Bigeye Thresher is generally deeper and less catchable than its tropical congener the Pelagic Thresher (A. pelagicus). The Bigeye Thresher is often retained for the meat and fins unless domestic or international regulations prohibit retention. However, high at-vessel mortality remains a threat where retention is prohibited. The species is estimated to be declining in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and increasing in a large area around Hawaii with the trends uncertain in the wider Pacific. Globally, the population is estimated to have reduced by 30â€“49% over the last three generations (55.5 years), based on abundance data and current levels of exploitation.

Alopias vulpinus,Vulnerable,"The Common Thresher (Alopias vulpinus) is a large (to 573 cm total length), circumglobal, coastal and pelagic shark that occurs from the surface down to depths of 650 m. It is long-lived (38 years), yet with larger litters (2â€“6 pups) and possibly an annual reproductive cycle, it consequently has a higher rate of population increase (0.254) than the Pelagic Thresher (A. pelagicus) and the Bigeye Thresher (A. superciliosus). The species is caught as target and bycatch in pelagic and coastal commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries.

Anoxypristis cuspidata,Critically Endangered,"The Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) is a large (to 350 cm total length) shark like-ray which historically was found widely across the Indoâ€“West Pacific, but it is now possibly extinct or has an uncertain presence throughout most of the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters and Southeast Asia. It is now only extant in Pakistan, parts of India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. It is benthopelagic and occurs at depths of 0â€“128 m with juveniles occupying nearshore and estuarine habitats, and adults occupying deeper shelf waters. The Narrow Sawfish is the most productive of the sawfish species, with an early age-at-maturity of 2â€“3 years, and an estimated maximum intrinsic rate of population increase of 0.27 per year. However, it may a higher post-release mortality than other sawfish.This species is taken as bycatch (and was historically targeted) in commercial and small-scale fisheries and often retained for its meat, fins, and rostra. Historically, its fins were considered among the most highly valued in the shark fin trade, and this high value drove demand and increased exploitation of the species over the past decades throughout its range. Habitat loss and the morphology of the rostrum, which is susceptible to capture in fishing gear, have also driven declines independently of trade. International trade of all sawfish species was prohibited in 2007 and 2013 with their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), however, illegal trade continues (especially for their rostra but in some areas also for their meat and fins). This species is exposed to moderate to heavy fishing pressure throughout most of its range. Furthermore, habitat loss and degradation has likely affected the population.It is suspected that the substantial declines in Narrow Sawfish across its range occurred prior to the past three generation lengths (18 years), that is, prior to the 2000s; however, population declines are ongoing. In the Arabian Sea and adjacent waters and eastwards to Southeast Asia, there are areas where the species is 'possibly extinct', 'presence uncertain', and extant, with steep population reductions of &gt;80% suspected over the past three generation lengths (18 years). Population reduction is suspected to be less severe in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea where it is still reported in some parts, and it is suspected to be 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths. In Australia, a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generations (18 years) is suspected, however, in recent years declines are suspected to be less than this due to protection and management measures. Overall, a weighted global population trend leads to a suspected &gt;80% population reduction over the past three generation lengths (18 years) due to actual levels of exploitation, habitat degradation, and a decline in extent of occurrence, and the Narrow Sawfish is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","Despite species-level protections in many countries, sawfish are still used for their fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs, and skin (McDavitt 2005, Dulvy et al. 2016, Haque et al. 2020, Grant et al. 2021a, Grant et al. 2021b). Sawfish fins are among the most valuable in the shark fin trade. International commercial trade of sawfish and their products was prohibited in 2007 when they were listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). However, illegal international trade appears ongoing due to the high value of their products. Sawfish products are traded online on the websites of Madagascan, Chinese, Indonesian, and Australian shark fin merchants (Harrison and Dulvy 2014). The meat and fins used to be dried in Pakistan and exported to Sri Lanka and China, respectively; and the meat of foetuses and small sawfish used to be locally consumed (M. Moazzam pers. comm. 22 April 2022). The meat is consumed locally by coastal communities and does not usually enter the trade in some regions. For instance, sawfish meat is sold in Bangladesh's western and central coastal regions, where it is believed to heal cancer and other diseases, and fins and skin are exported to Myanmar in cases where they were not locally consumed (Haque et al. 2020). Sawfish fin prices in Bangladesh are high and similar to those of some large shark species in Bangladesh; for example, a set of shark fins of &gt;51 cm can be sold for up to US$1,182 to international buyers. The sawfish meat can be sold for up to US$40 per kilogram locally (Haque and Spaet 2021). Some communities in Papua New Guinea (PNG) retain sawfish for cultural reasons, and rostra are routinely observed in houses of fishers for decorative purposes (Grant et al. 2021b). Anecdotal observations of rostra being sold in markets in Port Moresby indicate there is a domestic market for rostra, although no further information is available, and it is not considered that domestic trade of rostra is widespread (Grant et al. 2021a). Fins from sawfish are sold to local fin buyers, and observations of legal and illegal market chains in southern PNG indicate that fins likely enter global fin markets in East Asia (Busilacchi et al. 2021).Â Sawfish are culturally significant to First Nations peoples in Australia, where take is exclusively permitted for cultural, non-commercial purposes by specified Traditional Owners in their specified land and sea country. Cultural values have been documented for Traditional Owners from places including the Gulf of Carpentaria (McDavitt 2005), the Northern Territory (Morelli 2017), and Western Australia (National Indigenous Times 2019), and likely other places. Cultural use differs between Traditional Custodian Nations.

It is demersal onÂ continental and insular shelves, over sand, shell and coral, at depths of 18â€“64 m. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal commercial fisheries and retained primarily for meat.In the Western Central Atlantic, where management exists, it is estimated to have declined 2.8% per year over three generation lengths (26 years) based on stock assessments and scientific surveys. It is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generations in the region, as the population has recently stabilized and population projections from the stock assessment indicate rebuilding is possible, and species-specific management exists in the United States.In the Southwest Atlantic, due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal fisheries and in some areas commercial fisheries, which lack adequate management, and notable declines in landings in several areas, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (32 years in the Southwest Atlantic).Overall, due to the Southwest Atlantic occupying a large proportion of its overall global range and the only species-specific management occurring in the United States, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the last three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","Blacknose Shark is utilized primarily for meat.

Carcharhinus albimarginatus,Vulnerable,"The Silvertip Shark (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) is a large (to 300 cm total length) shark with a patchy distribution across the Indo-Pacific Ocean. It occurs on continental shelves, offshore islands, and coral reefs from the surface to depths of 800 m, can be relatively site-specific, and has slow population growth rates. The species is taken as target and bycatch in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with pelagic longlines, gillnet, demersal trawl, and a range of artisanal gear, and is retained mainly for its large fins and meat. Declines in abundance of &gt;50% have been noted in the Arabian Seas and adjacent waters and although it was previously common, it is now infrequently seen in the region. Significant declines of the species are also suspected in Southeast Asia and coral-reef associated shark species have globally declined by 60â€“73%. Populations of the Silvertip Shark are stable in protected areas and countries with managed fisheries, such as Australia. The species occurrence in upper continental slope habitats and deeper waters also provide it significant refuge from fisheries. Overall, while declines of &gt;50% are noted in parts of its range, the population is stable in some areas, and it has significant refuge at depth across large parts of its range.

Carcharhinus altimus,Near Threatened,"The Bignose Shark (Carcharhinus altimus) is a medium-sized (to 300 cm total length) shark that is patchily distributed in warm temperate and tropical waters worldwide. It inhabits continental shelves and upper slopes at depths of 0â€“810 m, with young mostly inshore and adults offshore close to the seafloor during the day and near the surface at night. The species is taken as bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with pelagic longline and purse seine, trawl, and gillnet, and is retained for the meat and fins. The population declined significantly over 30 years where it was previously targeted in the Maldives, prior to closure of the fishery in 2010. The population is suspected to have declined by 20â€“29% in the Northwest Atlantic and by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas over three generation lengths (60 years) due to fishing pressure. Elsewhere, there are no species-specific data however it is subject to intense and unregulated fishing pressure across approximately half of its range and has a low biological productivity and inferred high susceptibility to fisheries. There is lesser fishing pressure in the other half of its range where there are managed fisheries. It is suspected that the Bignose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (60 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2d.","The species is used for its meat, fins, skin, liver oil, and cartilage; the fins of adults are large and of high-value (White et al. 2006, Last and Stevens 2009, Fields et al. 2018).",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Bignose shark,"Albania, Algeria, Angola, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Fiji, France, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Greece, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Italy, Lebanon, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mayotte, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands (United Kingdom), Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Yemen"
Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides,Vulnerable,"The Graceful Shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchoides) is a medium-sized (to 178 cm total length) coastal shark that occurs in the Indo-West Pacific, from Australia to Somalia in nearshore habitats to a depth of 50 m. The biology and ecology of the species is poorly-known, but it is thought to have moderate productivity like other medium-sized carcharhinids. It is rarely targeted and mainly taken as bycatch and comprises only small proportions of catches in commercial and small-scale gillnet, longline, and trawl fisheries. Within Australian waters the fisheries that take the Graceful Shark are well managed, but through the rest of its range, management of shark populations is mostly lacking. We can infer that given its medium-size, and presence in coastal waters of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean where coastal fishing is intensive and extensive, it is likely threatened. Based on ongoing declines in species of similar life histories and catchability in fisheries, the Graceful Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Graceful Shark is retained for its meat and fins.

Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos,Endangered,"The Grey Reef Shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) is a medium-sized (to at least 225 cm TL) coastal shark that occurs in coral reef habitats in tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans from the surface down to a depth of at least 280 m. The species has relatively low biological productivity. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 254 reefs in 40 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 59.2% over three generation lengths (44 years). Therefore, the Grey Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the last three generation lengths (44 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","This is species is retained for its meat, fins, liver and skin.

It occurs in inshore and offshore waters from the surface down to at least 60 m. It has often been confused with the Bull Shark (C. leucas) confounding information on distribution and abundance. It matures late and has a biennial reproductive cycle resulting in low productivity. The species is taken as bycatch by multiple gears, including gillnet and longline, throughout its range. In Australian waters, it is taken only in limited amounts, however, in the remainder of its range it is subject to intensive coastal fisheries that have operated over many decades. No species-specific information on population decline is available, but there is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae spp.) across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 73% reduction in the Pigeye Shark over the past three generation lengths (65 years). The Pigeye Sharkâ€™s low productivity mean that it is likely to have declined through most of its range, however, it is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range.

Carcharhinus borneensis,Critically Endangered,"The Borneo Shark (Carcharhinus borneensis) is a small (to 70 cm total length) requiem shark known from Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) and a single â€˜doubtfulâ€™ specimen collected from Chu San Island in the Chekiang Province of China. The range of this species was possibly more widespread in the 1800s, and it is now much more restricted to off northwestern Borneo. This species was historically known only from five specimens, the last of which was collected in 1937 and the species was presumed extinct until recently rediscovered in 2004 with numerous specimens collected from Mukah, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Like other small requiem sharks, it was probably found in shallow inshore coastal waters less than 50 m deep, and hence is unlikely to have any depth refuge from fisheries. This species is known only from specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, and it is likely to have been fished throughout both its known and plausible range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s. Landings data of all carcharhinid sharks combined from the Indonesia and Malaysia Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates and rays from the IChina EEZs indicate populations reductions of 36â€“82% over the past three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. These have been directed searches for this species and there are a number of routine landings surveys throughout the region that would likely have recorded this species. It is now very rare throughout its likely historic range and has only recently been recorded only from Mukah, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). Overall, the Borneo Shark is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and actual or potential fishing levels, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2cd.","Sharks are heavily exploited and utilized inÂ SoutheastÂ Asia for their meat, fins,Â and other products (BlaberÂ et al.Â 2009, Lam and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2011, DharmadiÂ et al.Â 2015).

Carcharhinus brachyurus,Vulnerable,"The Copper Shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus) is a large (to 325 cm total length) shark that has a circumglobal but patchy distribution in warm temperate and subtropical waters from close inshore to depths of 145 m. It also occurs in brackish or freshwater in the lower reaches of rivers and in bays and has inshore nursery grounds. The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries with mainly longline and gillnet gear. It has a low biological productivity that would lower its resilience to fishing pressure. The Copper Shark appears to represent only a small part of the reported shark catches in most regions and may have a naturally low abundance across most of its range. Population trend data was available from South Africa for 26 years (1978â€“2003) and from South Australia for 17 years (2002â€“2018). In South Africa, the population was estimated to have increased over the past three generation lengths to 2003 (71 years) in the bather protection program, yet from 2003 to 2018, the CPUE steadily declined. In South Australia, the population was estimated to have undergone a reduction of 62.6% over three generation lengths (71 years). Elsewhere in Australia the population was considered stable, except for a potential decline in the New South Wales shark meshing program. The Copper Shark population has potentially increased in the Gulf of California, is potentially increasing or stable in New Zealand, and has potentially declined in the Southwest Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, and Peru. Except for the Northwest Pacific, where there has likely been an actual inferred decline in population abundance of 55â€“99% over the past three generation lengths (71 years), there is little concurrent effort data for this species in those regions and thus the population trend cannot be definitively determined; the changes may be due to environmental factors and changes in fishing practices. There is a high level of uncertainty with the estimated population trends, and over most of its range the Copper Shark appears to be declining. With a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Copper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (71 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","The species is used for its high-quality meat and for the fins which accounted for 0.3% of fin samples in Hong Kong (Da Silva and BÃ¼rgener 2007, Drew et al. 2017, Fields et al. 2018).",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Bronze whaler,"Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, China, Croatia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, Namibia, New Zealand, Peru, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Turkey, United States of America, Uruguay"
Carcharhinus brevipinna,Vulnerable,"The Spinner Shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) is a large (to 304 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Indo-West Pacific Oceans. It is coastal and pelagic in warm temperate and tropical waters on continental shelves at depths of 0â€“200 m. The low biological productivity combined with its schooling behaviour and tendency to occur in inshore waters make it susceptible to fishing pressure, although if the pressure is on the juveniles only, it can be sustainable. The species is taken as target and bycatch of industrial, small-scale, and recreational fisheries using a range of gears, including trawl, longline, and gillnets. Over the past three generation lengths (38 years), the population is estimated to have increased in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic in response to management measures and to have undergone a minor reduction of 3% in South Africa. It is suspected to have declined by &gt;30% in the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (38 years) and is inferred to have also declined in the Mexican Atlantic, Southwest Indian Ocean, West Africa, and Southeast Asia.

Carcharhinus cautus,Least Concern,"The Nervous SharkÂ (Carcharhinus cautus) is a medium-sized (to 150 cm total length) shark that occurs on continental and insular shelves in shallow tropical and subtropical waters to depths of 20 m across northern Australia, southern Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The species is likely to have moderate reproductive capacity with a relatively young age-at-maturity of six years and an annual or biennial breeding cycle. In Australia, it is taken mostly as bycatch in gillnet fisheries where it is sometimes retained for domestic consumption of the meat. The catch in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands is unknown but it is suspected to be taken in small-scale subsistence fisheries. The majority of the species' range is in Australian waters where all fisheries in which it is taken are managed; it has been reported as abundant in parts of Australia with reported catches stable in northwest Australia and minimal elsewhere. Therefore, the species is not suspected to be close to reaching the population reduction threshold and is assessed as Least Concern.

This species is caught in artisanal gillnet and longline and industrial trawl fisheries across its range. Gillnetting in the Gulf of California has been extensive and has led to the decline of various marine species. Shrimp trawling is prevalent in the southern Gulf of California, and this species has also been targeted there in artisanal fisheries since at least the 1960s. In Mexico, records of this species were relatively common from the 1950s to the 1980s, it became increasingly rare through the 1990s and early 2000s, and the last confirmed record is from 2001. Further south, intense and increasing artisanal fishing exists with very little management in place. Relative abundance decreased in the Colombian industrial shrimp trawl fishery between 1995 and 2004, which represented the equivalent of a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations (27 years).Â However, this species is still recorded in Pacific Colombian artisanal fisheries but with less frequency than in the past. Given its shallow depth range, this species has very little refuge from fishing. Overall, due to intense and largely unmanaged fishing pressure throughout its range, a lack of recent records in Mexico, and documented declines in Colombia, the Pacific Smalltail SharkÂ is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of more than 80% over the past three generations (27 years) based on levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","This shark's meat is salted or consumed fresh for local consumption, and fins and skins have been utilized in the past (Kato 1965).

It was common in inshore waters at depths to 100 m and is particularly susceptible to inshore fisheries. The species is caught in commercial trawling, artisanal fishing, hook-and-line fishing, and gillnetting throughout its range. It has a relatively low reproductive capacity (litters of 2-5 pups) making it particularly susceptible to over-exploitation. The Whitecheek Shark is often the dominant species landed in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (e.g. Iran and Qatar). However, off Pakistan and India, where it used to be common, there is evidence of declines exceeding 50-70% over the last 15 years with recent surveys in India and Sri Lanka failing to report the species. It is suspected that localized extinctions have likely occurred in Indian waters due to high levels of fishing pressure.Â The ongoing intensification of fisheries across its range, combined with reported declines of sharks in the region in general, lead to a suspected population decline of at least 50-70% over the past three generations (12 years) and further population reduction is suspected over the future three generation lengths (2018-2030) based on current levels of exploitation. As such this species is assessed as Endangered A2d+3d.","The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets across its range.

Carcharhinus falciformis,Vulnerable,"The Silky Shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) is an oceanic and coastal-pelagic shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical waters. It is a target or bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries where it is taken in high numbers. Silky Shark is one of the three most traded shark species in the global shark fin trade. Estimates of trends in abundance over three generations (45 years) from standardized catch rate and spawning biomass indices show declines of Silky Shark in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific Ocean, Western Central Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. Across all three ocean regions, there are the major uncertainties in estimates of catch rate and population changes, and an inability to conclusively attribute any declines solely to fishing mortality as there is some potential for environmental influences on catchability and sampling artefacts. The weighted global population trend estimated a 47-54% decline over three generations. This reflects the proportionate contribution of each regionâ€™s Silky Shark population change. The estimated level of decline and the uncertainties in the data warrants a global status of Vulnerable. This assessment should be revisited when more definitive catch data and stock assessments become available.","The meat of Silky Shark is used for human consumption, the fins are taken for the shark fin trade, the skin has been processed for leather and the liver has been used for liver oil (for its high vitamin A content in this species) (Vannuccini 1999).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Silky shark,"Albania, Algeria, American Samoa, Angola, Anguilla (United Kingdom), Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bermuda (United Kingdom), Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cayman Islands (United Kingdom), Chile, China, Christmas Island, Clipperton, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Fiji, France, French Guiana [FR], French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Gibraltar (United Kingdom), Greece, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guam, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, SAR, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macao, SAR, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Montserrat (United Kingdom), Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Republic of Korea, RÃ©union, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint-BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Helena and Dependencies (United Kingdom), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, State of Palestine, Sudan, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Virgin Islands of the USA, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Western Sahara, Yemen"

Carcharhinus galapagensis,Least Concern,"The Galapagos Shark (Carcharhinus galapagensis) is a large (to at least 300 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal but patchy distribution. It is highly associated with warm temperate and tropicalÂ oceanic islands and seamounts from the surface to depths of 285 m. The Galapagos Shark has limited biological productivity, and therefore limited ability to sustain exploitation. It is caught as bycatch in commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, both in pelagic oceanic waters and around islands and seamounts. The depletion of the Galapagos Shark has been reported at Saint Paul's Rocks, Brazil, and given the species' habitat specificity and limited biological productivity, has likely occurred elsewhere in places where fisheries are intense and unregulated, for example Madagascar. In contrast, the Galapagos Shark is suspected to be stable in a large part of its Pacific range, where it remains common in remote, protected, or lightly fished areas. Given this, and the species' wide range, the global population is not suspected to have undergone a population reduction reaching a level to suggest Near Threatened (i.e. 20â€“29%), and the species is assessed as Least Concern.

Carcharhinus hemiodon,Critically Endangered,"The Pondicherry Shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is a small (to 102 cm total length) and very rare Indo-West Pacific whaler shark. It has a wide historic range from Oman to southern China, but known records are scattered, and it has only been reliably verified from a handful of countries. It appears to occur in shallow coastal waters, and has also been reported to enter rivers, although this has not been verified.The contemporary range of this species is poorly defined and museum specimens were collected pre-1960. There are reports from 1979, the 1990s, and 2000, but none of these could be verified. Its identification is problematic, and it is easily confused with a number of other Carcharhinus species (for example, recent putative records from Sri Lanka).The Framework for using the Threats Model and the Records and Survey Model was applied to the Pondicherry Shark. The probability that the combination of threats (generally unregulated fisheries across its historic range) affecting the species occurred for a sufficient duration and were sufficiently severe that they caused local extinction, and the probability that threats occurred over the entire range of the species, were both very high. As a consequence, the probability that the species is extinct from the Threats Model is 0.81 (minimum = 0.64; maximum = 1.00). Its range has been subject to considerable survey effort directed at sharks and rays in general, and some dedicated searches for this species, all of which have failed to produce a verified record. Given the wide distribution of the species, these surveys have generally covered a small proportion of the speciesâ€™ range. Furthermore, given the identification issues, the probability that the species could have been reliably identified in the surveys is low. The probability that the species is extinct from the Records and Survey Model is 0.12 (minimum = 0; maximum = 0.31). The weighted average probability of extinction is 0.44â€“0.45, which is &lt;0.5 and therefore outside the threshold for Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct).Given a lack of verifiable records since 1960, it is considered that the major population reduction would have occurred prior to the last three generation period (estimated at 27 years from a congener), therefore an assessment under criterion A is not appropriate. However, given the lack of records, the number of mature individuals is assumed to be &lt;250 with no subpopulation &gt;50 mature individuals, and the species is assessed as Critically Endangered (C2a(i)).",This species was probably utilized locally for human consumption.,SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Pondicherry shark,"China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan"

There is little information on the abundance and biology of this species. Human's Whaler Shark is assessed as Data Deficient due to a lack of population trend data across its range which overlaps significantly with coastal inshore fisheries. This assessment should be revisited as further information becomes available.",The meat of this species is likely to be sold fresh for human consumption at local markets where it occurs.,SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Human's whaler shark,"Bahrain, Kuwait, Mozambique, South Africa, Yemen"
Carcharhinus isodon,Near Threatened,"The Finetooth Shark (Carcharhinus isodon)Â is a medium-sized (to 200 cm total length) coastal shark found in the Northwest Atlantic and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from North Carolina (USA), to the Gulf of Mexico and isolated areas in the Caribbean Sea and down to Brazil. It occurs off beaches, in bays, estuaries and river mouthsÂ from the intertidal to a depth of 20 m. It is caught as target catch and bycatch of coastal commercial fisheries primarily for meat.In the Northwest Atlantic, where management exists, Finetooth Shark has annually increased by 3.5% with the median change over three generation lengths (23 years) and corresponding probabilities for rates of population change all indicate an increasing population. However, in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, this species was formerly common in the 1970s and 1980s but due to the intense unmanaged fishing pressure there have been few records of this species in the past decade. Consequently, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) in the Southwest Atlantic portion of its range.Overall, due to Brazil occupying about 20% of its overall global range and the increasing population in the Northwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the Finetooth Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (23 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Finetooth Shark is harvested commercially and recreationally and utilized primarily for meat. Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014â€“2015, Finetooth Shark comprised 0.09â€“0.13% of the fin trade (FieldsÂ et al. 2018, CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020).",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Finetooth shark,"Brazil, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"
Carcharhinus leiodon,Endangered,"The Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus leiodon) is endemic to the Arabian Seas region and was only rediscovered in 2009. Overall, there are a limited number of specimens reported. It is believed to occur in inshore waters where it is captured in gillnet, line and trawl fisheries within its range. Its recent re-discovery and re-description means that historically it has likely been under-recorded, however reliable identification of Carcharhinus species since then indicates that this species is rare and localised.Although there are limited data on its status, similar commercially important Carcharhinus species in the Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') have undergone significant declines. One of the areas in which the Smoothtooth Blacktip Shark is known from (southern Oman/eastern Yemen) has been, and continues to be, subject to intensive fishing targeted at sharks, suggesting suspected population declines of 50-80% are appropriate for this species. The other known centre of abundance around Kuwait is also subject to habitat degradation and change from water management practices in the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Furthermore, the loss and modification of coastal habitats in the Gulf is a significant concern for inshore species such as this. A further population reduction is suspected over three generation lengths (2017-2042) based on current levels of exploitation. The limited geographic range of this species compared to other similar ""blacktip"" species increase the risks to this species. As such it is assessed as Endangered under criterion A2cd+3cd. Further research and monitoring are required to better understand the distribution, biology, ecology and population status of this species.","The meat of this species may be sold fresh for human consumption at local markets in the region. In some countries, such as Oman and Yemen, the meat is cut into fillets, dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries.

Carcharhinus leucas,Vulnerable,"The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a large (to 400 cm total length) coastal shark with a circumglobal distribution. It is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore to a depth of 164 m, but mostly to ~30 m depth. The species is euryhaline and commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters. In some areas, it has often been confused with the Pigeye Shark (C. amboinensis) confounding information on distribution and abundance. The species is captured as target and bycatch by multiple fishing gears, including gillnet and longline, throughout its range and mostly retained for its meat and fins. Species-specific population trend data reveal the population is increasing in the Northwest Atlantic, likely in response to management measures, and decreasing in South Africa most likely due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, little data is available, but there is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range despite ongoing high levels of fishing effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 73% population reduction in the Bull Shark over the average past three generation lengths (68 years). This level of decline is not species-specific and while informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region, should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (55â€“80 years) due to declines in habitat quality and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The Bull Shark is used for its meat which is consumed fresh locally and dried and exported and for its fins (Fields et al. 2018, CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020).

Carcharhinus limbatus,Vulnerable,"The Blacktip Shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) is a medium-sized (to 286 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate seas. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 140 m, though mostly it occurs close inshore. It also often occurs in large schools near the surface, and it has inshore nursery grounds. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. The Blacktip Shark is estimated to be sustainably fished in areas where management measures are in place, i.e., the United States Gulf of Mexico, North Atlantic, Australia, and South Africa. Species-specific population trend data from these regions reveal population reductions of &lt;20% over the past three generation lengths in the Gulf of Mexico and South Africa (27â€“45 years). The North Atlantic population reduction in the spawning stock fecundity was not to a level where the stock was overfished, while in Australia, stock assessments on the Blacktip Shark complex indicate stocks have recovered from previous overfishing and are now sustainable. In the Arabian Seas region, a population decline of 30â€“49% is suspected for the Blacktip Shark. Elsewhere, little data is available, but the species is exposed to intensive and unmanaged fishing effort and due to its preference for inshore habitats, has limited refuge from fishing pressure. There is evidence of declines in general shark catches in many parts of its range where there is a lack of management, despite ongoing high levels of effort; declines in whaler sharks across the regions Large Marine Ecosystems equate to a 54% reduction in the Blacktip Shark over the average past three generation lengths (38 years).

Carcharhinus obsoletus,Critically Endangered,"The Lost Shark (Carcharhinus obsoletus) is a small requiem shark from the southern South China Sea (Gulf of Thailand, Viet Nam, and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo) in the Western Central Pacific, but it may have had a wider historic distribution in the southern South China Sea. This species is known only from three type specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, the last of which was collected in 1934.Â The maximum size is unknown but, based on similar species, it likely reached a size of ~100 cm total length.Â Like other small requiem sharks it was probably found in shallow inshore coastal waters less than 50 m deep, and hence is unlikely to have any depth refuge from fisheries. There are three lines of evidence in support of this species being extinct and three lines of evidence against. First, this species is known only from three type specimens recorded from fish landing sites and markets, the last of which was collected in 1934. Second, it is likely to have been fished throughout both its known and plausible range for the past century and particularly intensively since the 1960s and is likely to have undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% in the past three generation lengthsÂ (27 years)Â (and also the past three generations prior). Third, there is considerable passive surveillance and there have been five directed taxonomic surveys likely to record and identify this species. Yet, there have been no reasonably convincing, recent local reports or unconfirmed sightings since this species was first flagged as an undescribed species in the late 1970s. The three lines of evidence against extinction are that first, it does not have any ecological specialisation that might predispose to extinction. Second, it is a small requiem shark and might be easily confused with or gone unnoticed among large catches or collections of other carcharhinids. Third, the recent rediscovery of two other â€˜lostâ€™ carcharhinid species caution that further specimens of the Lost shark might be found in the future. Taken together, the Lost Shark is suspected to have undergone population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) and the remaining population size is suspected to be fewer than 50 individualsÂ and is inferred to be continuing to declineÂ due to actual or potential fishing levels.

Carcharhinus perezi,Endangered,"The Caribbean Reef Shark (Carcharhinus perezi) is a medium-sized (to 295 cm TL) reef-dwelling shark found throughout the Western Central Atlantic from the North Carolina (United States of America) the Bahamas, the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea to Brazil. It occurs mainly on coral reefs on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 378 m.This inshore shark has low productivity due to a biennial reproductive cycle with a one-year-long gestation and relatively small litters of 3â€“6 pups. It is taken as target species and as bycatch in artisanal and commercial fisheries throughout its range. In areas where it is not protected, there have been population reductions of 99% over the past three generation lengths (29 years) based on Baited Remote Underwater Videos Stations (BRUVS). However, in areas where protection measures are in place such as â€œshark sanctuariesâ€ (e.g. Bahamas), the population has remained relatively stable since the 1980s. A comparison of the number of sharks per reef throughout the Caribbean Sea based on BRUVS data also suggest abundance is six times higher in areas where protections are in place.A preliminary estimate indicates that 20% of the Caribbean is designated as â€œshark sanctuaryâ€ where commercial shark fishing is prohibited providing some protection for Caribbean Reef Shark. The reef area weighted population depletion level for Caribbean Reef Shark estimates a population reduction of 52.5% (standard error 40.4â€“64.5%) assuming that this depletion occurred over the past three generation lengths (29 years). The range in estimated population reduction includes both the Vulnerable and Endangered Red List categories, but most of the range is within the Endangered category. Due to the relatively high level of inadequately-managed fishing pressure, its relatively unproductive life history, the lack of enforcement in established protected areas, and a continuing decline in habitat quality, it is estimated that the Caribbean Reef Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (29 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.Â ","The Caribbean Reef Shark is used for meat, fins, leather (skin), oil (livers) and fishmeal (from carcasses). In Colombia, the jaws and livers are used for ornaments and oil, respectively, while the meat is only occasionally used as it is not easily marketed. Based on trimmings of shark fins from Guangzhou and Hong Kong, Caribbean Reef Shark were not reported as part of the fin trade (CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020). SCUBA diving with these sharks has become a very popular form of ecotourism. For example, in 2007, divers experienced an estimated 73,000 shark interactions in the Bahamas, generating roughly US $78 million in annual revenue (Cline 2008), and Haas et al.

Carcharhinus plumbeus,Endangered,"The Sandbar Shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) is a medium-sized (to at least 240 cm total length) shark with a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate seas. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from close inshore to a depth of 280 m. The species is captured as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries and is retained for the high value meat and fins, unless regulations prohibit retention. Species-specific population trend data reveal population reductions of &gt;50% and &gt;80% in the United States and South Africa, respectively over the past three generation lengths (60â€“78 years), and stock assessments in Australia indicate a reduction of 60% over the past three generation lengths (78 years). It is also suspected to have declined by 50â€“79% in the Mediterranean and the Arabian Seas region over the past three generation lengths (60â€“78 years). All of these declines are attributed to fisheries exploitation. There are signs of population recovery in areas where management measures are in place, such as the United States, South Africa, and Australia. In the Southwest Atlantic and West Africa, where species-specific information is lacking, there are high levels of unmanaged fisheries exploitation, and it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has also declined in those areas. Overall, it is suspected that the Sandbar Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generations lengths (60â€“78 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The species is used for its valuable meat and fins and to a lesser extent for its skin and liver oil (Last and Stevens 2009, Ebert et al. 2013).

Carcharhinus porosus,Critically Endangered,"The Smalltail Shark (Carcharhinus porosus) is a small (&lt;150 cm total length) coastal requiem shark that historically occurred in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from the central, western and southern Gulf of Mexico and along the Caribbean coast of Central and South America to the state of ParanÃ¡ in southern Brazil, not including the Caribbean Islands. This shark inhabits muddy inshore areas and estuaries to a depth of 84 m and is captured in artisanal gillnets and in commercial trawl fisheries. The meat is likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold locally in most places. The probability of catching this shark over time has declined in all parts of its range from 1970 to 2015, with particularly drastic declines in the southern Gulf of Mexico and off South America. In northern Brazil, this species is still captured in shrimp trawls and gillnet fisheries in AmapÃ¡ and ParÃ¡, but numbers have declined significantly, and it is now rare inÂ MaranhÄo. Catch rates decline from 2.87 kg per hour to 0.43 kg per hour in the 2000s, equivalent to a population reduction of 85% over three generation lengths (27 years).Â Records are becoming increasingly rare across eastern and southern Brazil, where this species has not been recorded for more than 15 years from the eleven states between CearÃ¡ (in the northeastern Brazil), toÂ ParanÃ¡ (in the southeastern Brazil). Demographic modelling suggests the fishing mortality far exceeded population growth rates and a population reduction of &gt;90% over three generations was estimated for the core distribution of this species. Due to the intense and largely unmanaged nature of fisheries in the region, the decreasing probability of catches, the relative lack of recent records in many parts of its range, and alarming declines in other elasmobranchs in the core of its range (northern South America), it is suspected that this shark has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and the Smalltail Shark is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.Â ","In general, requiem sharks in general are fished and valued for their meat, liver oil, and fins (Ebert et al. 2013), and this species is likely to be used similarly where it is fished.

Carcharhinus sealei,Vulnerable,"The Blackspot Shark (Carcharhinus sealei) is a small (to 95 cm total length) requiem shark distributed through the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) and Indo-Malay peninsula ranging from Myanmar to the Philippines in the Eastern Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans. It occurs inshore on insular and continental shelves from the surface to a depth of 40 m. This species is subject to intense commercial and artisanal fisheries throughout its geographic and depth range. It is taken as retained bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal trawls and gillnets. This species is used for its fins and meat but is of limited value due to its small size. Reconstructed catches of all requiem sharks, combined from the Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, and the Indonesian Sea, infer a population reduction of 44% over three generation lengths (24 years). This level of decline is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. The likely relatively short generation length may provide the Blackspot Shark some resilience to fishing pressure, however, there are signs of declines and potential disappearance in Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and eastern Indonesia. It is suspected that the Blackspot Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (24 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed Vulnerable A2d.","This species is used for its fins and meat but is of limited value due to its small size (Last et al. 2010).

Carcharhinus signatus,Endangered,"The Night Shark (Carcharhinus signatus) is a medium-sized (to 280 cm total length) requiem shark that occurs in the Northwest, Western Central, and Southwest Atlantic from New York, USA to RÃ­o Negro, Argentina, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Islands and in the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic from Senegal to Namibia. It is pelagic and semi-oceanic and inhabits outer continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 600 m, although it is typically found at depths of 26â€“365 m.In the Northwest Atlantic, Night Shark make up a significant proportion of the shark bycatch in the pelagic longline fishery off the southeast United States and there has been a steady decline in catch-per-unit-effort since 1996, which suggests the population is declining despite a prohibition on commercial harvest in 1999. This decline equates to an estimated population reduction of 50â€“79% over three generation lengths (50 years).In the Southwest Atlantic, this species is very rare and is only known from a few specimens in Caribbean Colombia. In Venezuela, there are no data but the intense and unmanaged longlining and gillnetting occurring off offshore islands which is suspected to be leading to declines there. In Brazil, there are no time-series specific to this species, but the reported landings of â€˜Machoteâ€™, which includes the species and the Silky Shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), declined by 77% between 2001â€“2009 and the government subsequently assessed Night Shark as regionally Vulnerable. In the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) due to actual fishing levels.In the Eastern Central and Southeast Atlantic, Night Shark was documented there in the 1960s, however, there is little historic information to determine whether the species was always rare or has actually since declined. Night Shark has not been recorded recently and has not been recently captured by the Portuguese longline fishery. Given the high degree of industrial and artisanal fishing effort in this region, it is likely the species has declined by an equivalent amount to that in the west Atlantic.Overall, based on the combination of high fishing mortality throughout its range, estimated population reduction in the US pelagic longline fishery and suspected declines elsewhere, this species is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","The Night Shark is caught in primarily pelagic longline fisheries and when retained is used for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin (Carlson et al. 2008).

Carcharhinus sorrah,Near Threatened,"The Spottail Shark (Carcharhinus sorrah) is a medium-sized (to 196 cm total length) coastal shark that occurs throughout much of the tropical Indo-West Pacific from the surface to at least 140 m depth. This is among the most productive of sharks with fast growth rates, early maturity, and moderate fecundity, suggesting that this species is more resilient to exploitation relative to most other shark species. It is caught as target and bycatch throughout its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline and demersal trawls, and is retained for its meat, fins, skin, teeth and liver oil. It is often one of the species most commonly still caught in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries throughout southern and south-east Asia, and Australia. Limited species-specific data is available on the population trend, but carcharhinid sharks throughout much of the region have declined due to the intensive level of fishing pressure. In northern Australia, the species has recovered from historic overfishing and is currently sustainably fished, providing some refuge for the species. While the Spottail Shark's high productivity allows it to sustain higher levels of fishing mortality than many other species, there are reports that its abundance has declined in areas with very intensive fishing. Therefore, the Spottail Shark is suspected to almost meet decline criteria and is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting the criteria for Vulnerable A2d.","This species is retained for its meat, fins, liver oil, and skin.

Carcharhinus tilstoni,Least Concern,"The Australian Blacktip SharkÂ (Carcharhinus tilstoni) is a common, medium-sized shark (to 200 cm total length), endemic to tropical and temperate northern Australian waters. This species is more resilient to exploitation than many other shark species due to its moderate growth rate, relatively early maturity, and moderate fecundity. The commercial fisheries with the most significant catches of the Australian Blacktip Shark are the Northern Territory Offshore Net and Line Fishery, the Queensland East Coast Inshore Fin Fish Fishery, and the Gulf of Carpentaria Inshore Fin Fish Fishery. Small catches are also taken from the Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (New South Wales), and it is no longer harvested commercially in Western Australia. Catches from all these fisheries are well documented but because of identification difficulties it is reported as a species-complex with the similar-looking Blacktip Shark (C. limbatus). During the mid-1980s, a steep decrease in both catch-per-unit-effort and average size provided strong evidence of a population decline due to heavy fishing pressure by a Taiwanese gillnet fleet that operated off northern Australia, with the decline estimated to be the equivalent of 93% over three generations (30 years). The fishery ceased in 1986 and was replaced by smaller domestic fisheries, that catch much lower quantities of this species. Under these lower levels of harvest, Stock Reduction Analysis models have estimated a recovery of the population in the Northern Territory to up to 90% of unfished biomass levels. This finding is supported by a tag recapture study that estimated a recovery from the period of heavy fishing and concluded that the population is stable under current catch rates. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is known to occur off northern Australia and the IUU catch of this species is unknown. It is caught by recreational and Indigenous fishers but catches are minor in comparison to the commercial fisheries that target this shark across northern Australia. The Australian Blacktip Shark is known to hybridize with the Blacktip SharkÂ and hybrids are known to occur in significant numbers throughout their sympatric range. The effect of hybridization on the population dynamics remain unknown. Despite the undefined effects of IUU fishing and hybridization, the well documented recovery of this species from declines in the mid-1980s and the implementation of conservative management measures controlling harvest to much lower levels than historical catches, support an assessment of Least Concern. However, because of its importance as a target species for a number of northern Australian fisheries and the uncertain effect of hybridization on population viability, ongoing monitoring and updating of stock assessments remains important.","This species is harvested in commercial, recreational, and Indigenous fisheries for its meat and fins.",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Australian blacktip shark,Australia
Carcharhinus tjutjot,Vulnerable,"The Indonesian Whaler Shark (Carcharhinus tjujot) is a small-sized shark (to at least 94 cm total length) with a patchy known distribution in Southeast Asia (Java, Borneo, and Taiwan; although it probably occurs more widely). It is an inshore species that mostly inhabits depths less than 100 m and is particularly susceptible to inshore fisheries. Inshore populations of similar species (e.g. Whitecheek Shark C. dussumieri) have declined dramatically in other regions of the world. Although the Indonesian Whaler Shark likely matures early and breeds annually, the low reproductive capacity (usual litter size of two pups) makes it susceptible to over-exploitation. The limited extent of the species' distribution combined with the intensive fishing pressure across its entire range, as well as habitat degradation, lead to a suspected population decline of &gt;30% over the past three generations (12 years) with further population reduction suspected over the future three generations lengths (2018-2030) based on potential levels of exploitation and a decline in the quality of habitat.

It is caught globally, mostly as bycatch in inshore fisheries by a range of gears, is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries, and is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks. Over three generation lengths (159 years), the White Shark is estimated to be increasing in abundance in the Northeast Pacific and Indian Ocean, and declining in abundance from historic levels in the Northwest Atlantic and South Pacific. In most regions, declines occurred during the 1980s followed by slow recovery since the 1990s when protection was implemented. Globally, based on long-term abundance data and protections instigated in the 1990s that have since reduced catches and allowed some recovery, the White Shark population is estimated to have reduced by 30â€“49% over the last three generations (159 years), and is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.",The White Shark fins and jaws have a high market value with large fins used as display items (Clarke 2004).

Eusphyra blochii,Critically Endangered,"The Winghead Shark (Eusphyra blochii) is a medium-sized (to 186 cm total length) hammerhead shark that historically was found widely across the Indo-West Pacific. However, due primarily to fishing pressure, it is now 'possibly extinct' in northern Southeast Asia and its presence is uncertain across much of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and southern Southeast Asia. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf from inshore to a depth of 127 m, and its habitats include estuarine, inshore, and offshore areas. This speciesâ€™ contemporary persistence in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal is mostly unclear, excluding a few anecdotal contemporary observations in Pakistan and India, and evidence of persisting populations in a small range in Sri Lanka. It is suspected to have undergone a severe reduction in its extent of occurrence in its northern Indian Ocean range and extant populations are suspected to be undergoing severe population reductions. Similarly in Southeast Asia, this species is now considered 'possibly extinct' throughout its former range in northern Southeast Asia (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan) and is no longer observed in landing surveys within most of its former range in Malaysia and Indonesia. This species is persisting and is widespread in coastal areas of the Island of New Guinea (Indonesia, Papua and West Papua; Papua New Guinea), although it is exposed to high fishing pressure. Along the southern coast of New Guinea, the Winghead Shark has high bycatch levels, and substantial declines in abundance are likely occurring and projected to continue in the near future. In Australia, this species is widespread and population reductions are not suspected to be as severe as other global regions owing to reductions in fishing intensity, low levels of catch, and an increase in Marine Protected Areas in the species' range. Overall, it is inferred that global population trend indicates a population reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (42 years: 1982â€“2024) due to actual levels of exploitation, a decline in the extent of occurrence, and habitat degradation in most of its range, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd).","The species is caught and consumed, and fins are traded.

Glaucostegus cemiculus,Critically Endangered,"The Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus) is a medium-sized (to 265 cm total length) shark-like ray with a wide distribution in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the northern coast of Portugal to Angola, including the Mediterranean Sea. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 80 m. Giant guitarfishes have limited biological productivity; the Blackchin Guitarfish has an annual fecundity of 5-24 and an estimated generation length of 15 years.Â The â€˜whiteâ€™ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)Â are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including the Blackchin Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific giant guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger giant guitarfish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Blackchin Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades. Furthermore, the Blackchin Guitarfish was historically common throughout the northern Mediterranean Sea but has now disappeared from former areas of its range. It is inferred that the Blackchin Guitarfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2d.","Giant guitarfishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.

It inhabits inshore waters in turbid estuaries, river mouths, and shallow banks at depths of 4â€“40 m. This species is targeted, along with other sharks, and/or caught as bycatch in intense and largely unregulated artisanal and commercial gillnet and trawl fisheries. Gillnet and trawl fishing effort is intense across much of coastal Atlantic South America with general patterns of decline and sequential overfishing. In northwest Brazil, the decline of this species is well-documented, with the species commonly landed in the 1980s and subsequently becoming increasingly rare to the point where single records are noteworthy. There are very few recent records, with most recent record a neonate captured in 2016. Demographic analysis revealed a population decline of 18.4% per year between 1992 and 2002, equivalent to a &gt;99% population reduction over three generations. Overall, due to the intense and unmanaged fishing pressure that this species is exposed to, its slow life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to overfishing, inferred and estimated declines, the paucity of recent records, and ongoing habitat degradation, it is inferred that the Daggernose SharkÂ has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (27 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","This species' fins and meat are not of high quality, and therefore the meat is only likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold locally in most places.",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Daggernose shark,"Brazil, French Guiana [FR], Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"

Isurus paucus,Endangered,"The Longfin Mako (Isurus paucus) is a large (to 427 cm total length), widely distributed but infrequently encountered, pelagic oceanic shark. It usually occurs to depths of 760 m, but has been reported to 1,752 m. The species is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries that operate throughout its range. It is caught less frequently than the Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and is usually retained for the meat and fins. Most catches of the Longfin Mako are inadequately recorded and likely underestimated in landings data, particularly as it is commonly misidentified as the Shortfin Mako. The Longfin Mako is of serious conservation concern due to its apparent rarity, large maximum size, low fecundity, and continued, poorly-documented take in intensive fisheries. The limited available population trend data indicates strong declines and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% globally over the last three generations (75 years), similar to its congener, the Shortfin Mako. The Longfin Mako is therefore assessed as Endangered A2d. As this assessment includes only one time series and is based on suspected declines, the assessment should be revisited when catch data are available from more regions.",The meat and fins of the Longfin Mako are traded (Clarke et al. 2006).,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,"Longfin Mako, Longfin mako shark, Mako","Albania, Algeria, Angola, Anguilla (United Kingdom), Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda (United Kingdom), Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Brunei Darussalam, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands (United Kingdom), Chile, China, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, France, French Guiana [FR], Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Gibraltar (United Kingdom), Greece, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guam, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, SAR, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Kiribati, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macao, SAR, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Montserrat (United Kingdom), Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Republic of Korea, RÃ©union, Russian Federation, Saint Helena and Dependencies (United Kingdom), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, State of Palestine, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Virgin Islands of the USA, Western Sahara, Yemen"
Lamiopsis tephrodes,Endangered,"The Borneo Broadfin Shark (Lamiopsis tephrodes) is a medium-sized (to 157 cm total length) shark in the Western Central and Northwest Pacific occurring in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, and likely occurs more widely through the Indo-Malay Archipelago to southern China. It is found inshore on the continental shelf in depths of less than 50 m, associated with turbid estuarine waters. The species is caught in a variety of gears including demersal trawls and gillnets and the meat is retained for human consumption and the fins are traded. This species was recently resurrected and hence there is little information on former and current catches. Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Reconstructed catches of mainly carcharhinids and elasmobranchs in Gulf of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia (Peninsular and Sarawak), and China can be used to infer population reductions of 28â€“76% when these declines are scaled to the suspected three generation lengths of the Borneo Broadfin Shark (20 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in carcharhinid sharks, particularly in the central part of this species distribution. The species is exposed to intense fishing pressure and has no refuge from fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Borneo Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (20 years) due to actual or potential fishing levels, and it is assessed as Endangered A2d.","The meat of this species is often sold fresh for human consumption at local markets across the region.

Lamna nasus,Vulnerable,"The Porbeagle (Lamna nasus) is a large (to 357 cm total length) pelagic shark with an anti-tropical and disjunct distribution, occurring in the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere in temperate and cold-temperate waters to depths of 1,809 m. There are two separate subpopulations, the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species has low biological productivity with small litters, late age-at-maturity, and a shorter life span of 26 years in the North Atlantic compared to 60 years in the Southern Hemisphere. Globally, the species is targeted and caught incidentally in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, as well as by rod and reel, and is often retained for the high-value meat as well as its fins. Steep declines have occurred in the North Atlantic; with declines also evident, though not as steep, in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic subpopulation reduction was 50â€“79% over three generations (58.5 years) and the Southern Hemisphere subpopulation reduction was &lt;20% over three generations (114.9 years). The overall estimated median reduction was 26.5%, with a 41.5% probability of &lt;20% reduction and 45.5% probability of &gt;30% reduction over three generations. Expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate that globally, the reduction is 30â€“49% over three generations (58.5 and 114.9 years) and therefore, the Porbeagle is assessed globally as Vulnerable A2bd.","The Porbeagle is used for its fins, liver oil, and high-quality meat (Francis et al. 2008, Hernandez et al. 2008). Together with the Salmon Shark, the two species accounted for 0.2% of the fin imported in Hong Kong in 2014 (Fields et al. 2018).

Loxodon macrorhinus,Near Threatened,"The Sliteye Shark (Loxodon macrorhinus) is a small (to 99 cm total length) shark that occurs from eastern South Africa to southern Japan and the Australian east coast, that is, in the Indian Ocean and Northwest and Western Central Pacific. It is demersal on continental and insular shelves at depths of 2â€“120 m and prefers areas of high water clarity. The species is captured as bycatch and occasionally targeted, in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line, and is retained for its meat, and to a lesser extent for its fins. The population is suspected to be declining across most of its range except for within Australia where there is likely a stable population due to the low to moderate managed fishing pressure. Although the Sliteye Shark is a productive species which likely increases its resilience to fishing pressure, it is subject to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range. It is still common in parts of its Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia regions but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Another small productive shark species, the Milk Shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus) with a similar spatial and depth range has undergone steep population declines in parts of its range. Declines in other shark species and demersal fisheries resources across more than half of Sliteye Sharkâ€™s range are also reported. Taking a precautionary approach, it is suspected that the Sliteye Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2d.","The species is used for its meat which is often consumed fresh but also dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries.

Mobula alfredi,Vulnerable,"The Reef Manta Ray (Mobula alfredi) is a large (to 500 cm disc width) ray with a tropical and subtropical distribution throughout much of the Indian and Pacific Oceans in coastal and pelagic waters from the surface to 432 m deep. The global population size is not known, but some local and regional population sizes have been estimated and are mostly small, at fewer than 1,000 individuals, except for the Maldives where the population is estimated at ~10,000. While individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently, consequently aggregations are widely separated with low connectivity resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion. The species has an extremely slow life history, producing only one pup on average every 4â€“5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) among elasmobranchs. Reef Manta Rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale industrial tuna fisheries. The meat is consumed locally, and they are traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. Where Reef Manta Rays are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. Elsewhere, however, very rapid declines in sightings records have occurred where they are targeted or caught as bycatch. For example, Reef Manta Ray sightings declined by 98% over a 15-year period (half a generation span) in southern Mozambique. Where fishing pressure is higher, the Reef Manta Ray is suspected to have declined to the point of local extinction in many places throughout much of the Indian Ocean. Globally, the suspected population reduction is 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (87 years) with further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â€“2105). The suspected past and future population reduction is based on extremely low maximum rates of population increase, current and ongoing levels of exploitation, steep decline estimates, and reduction in extent of occurrence due to suspected local and regional extinctions, offset only by stable trajectories in a relatively few well-protected areas. The Reef Manta Ray is therefore assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2bcd+3d).","Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier et al. 2012). The gill plates fetch high prices in Asia and are used for Chinese health tonics (Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017).

Mobula birostris,Endangered,"The Oceanic Manta Ray (Mobula birostris) is a large (to 700 cm disc width) ray with a circumglobal distribution in tropical and temperate waters throughout the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans in coastal and pelagic waters from the surface to a depth of 1,000 m. Within this broad range, aggregations are sparsely distributed and while individuals are capable of long-distance movements they do so infrequently and exhibit a degree of philopatry resulting in a high likelihood of local depletion. The global population size is not known, but local and regional abundance has been estimated and is mostly small, numbering less than 500 individuals, except for Ecuador where abundance is estimated at more than 2,000 individuals. The species has an extremely slow life history, producing only 1 pup on average every 4â€“5 years, and consequently is likely to have one of the lowest maximum rates of population increase (median 0.032 per year) of any elasmobranch. Oceanic Manta Rays are targeted or taken as bycatch in artisanal small-scale fisheries, as well as taken as bycatch in large-scale tuna fisheries. The meat is consumed locally, and the species is traded internationally due to the rapid rise of the valuable gill plate trade. Where Oceanic Manta Ray are protected (in over a dozen countries and territories), and hence where they are not being fished, the sighting trends appear stable. Elsewhere, however, very rapid declines have been noted in sightings records and landings where they are targeted or caught as bycatch; these range from 71 to 95% declines over 13- to 21-year periods (all less than one generation length of 29 years). It is suspected that the Oceanic Manta Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (87 years), with further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â€“2105) due to current and ongoing levels of exploitation, and a reduction in area of occupancy due to suspected local and regional extinctions, and it is assessed as Endangered (EN A2bcd+A3d).","Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier et al. 2012).

Mobula hypostoma,Endangered,"The Atlantic Pygmy Devil Ray (Mobula hypostoma) is a medium-sized (to 120 cm disc width) coastal pelagic ray endemic to the Atlantic Ocean to depths of 100 m. Like most species of Mobula, the Atlantic Pygmy Devil Ray has a very low reproductive output, with a late estimated age-at-maturity and low fecundity, and presumably a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored mobulid fisheries worldwide. Due mainly to its schooling behaviour and its coastal near-shore distribution, this species is likely a bycatch component of many small-scale fisheries; this fishing effort has largely been unreported, with catches often generalized as Mobula species. This species is widespread throughout the tropics and temperate waters of the Atlantic and depletions of the Atlantic Pygmy Devil Ray are suspected in some parts of its range based on reduced sightings, and declines in catches and landings in recent years. It is now absent from many areas believed to be a part of its former geographic range, and there have been few sightings in many countries, particularly in Brazil. Trends from genus-wide data, where devil rays face heavy fishing pressure outside the range of the Atlantic Pygmy Devil Ray, indicate significant declines of 51 to 94% over 10- to 15-year periods (~one generation length). The levels of fishing pressure resulting in these declines are similar to that likely in West Africa. Based on current and future levels of exploitation, declining trends, and a reduction in area of occupancy, it is suspected that this species has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the last three generations (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2019â€“2057) due to ongoing demand for high-value products.

Mobula kuhlii,Endangered,"The Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray (Mobula kuhlii) is a medium-sized (to 135 cm disc width) ray with an Indo-Pacific distribution in temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters. It is a mainly inshore continental shelf species that occurs in coastal areas from the surface to depths of 50 m. The Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray has a low reproductive output with one pup born, possibly every 1â€“3 years, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity and be incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devil ray (Mobula spp.) fisheries worldwide. The Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray is a large component of targeted fisheries in Indonesia and Pakistan, and was previously targeted in the Philippines. This species is also a bycatch component of many small and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated and reported as Mobula spp. The lack of species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, catches and landings are steadily decreasing despite stable or increasing effort, suggesting that populations are declining worldwide. Notable declines in landings of 93% over 14 years have been documented at one fishing landing site in Indonesia, while at another site, the species was caught in low numbers in 2001â€“05 but was not recorded in 2013â€“14. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of devil rays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50â€“99% over the past three generations (38 years). Less information is available in other regions, but it is suspected, based on known threats, that those populations are in decline as well. However, the data in many regions are uncertain; they may not accurately reflect true abundance and many of the trends are from genus-wide data rather than species-specific data. Caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction. Based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray global population has undergone a reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2020â€“2058) due to ongoing demand for high-value products, and it is assessed as Endangered (EN A2bd+3d).","The Shorthorned Pygmy Devil Ray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates.

Mobula mobular,Critically Endangered,"The Spinetail Devil Ray (Mobula mobular) is a large (to 350 cm disc width) pelagic ray with a circumglobal distribution in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans, occurring from the surface to depths of 700 m. Little is known about its biology and ecology, although it is inferred from other Mobula species to produce a single pup every one to three years, and therefore, it is slow to recover from overfishing.The Spinetail Devil Ray is captured as target and incidental catch in industrial and small-scale purse seine and gillnet fisheries, and is retained for its meat and gill plates. It is a large component of these fisheries in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, India, and Peru, but across its global range, much of this catch remains unreported. Within its broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. Notable declines in landings of 50â€“96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and local extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. However, in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific countries, the threat is likely to be far lower than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and stronger fisheries management. Increasing trade in gill plates and meat has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored mobulid ray (Mobula spp.) fisheries worldwide.The limited species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, Mobula catches and landings have steadily decreased despite stable or increasing fishing effort, indicating globally populations have also declined. Since the 2000s, significant population reductions have been estimated, suspected, or inferred in many regions including Southeast Asia, the Eastern Pacific, and the Indian Ocean where mobulid rays are heavily exploited. Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of mobulid rays in several regions, with suspected local and regional declines of 50â€“99% over the last three generation lengths (48 years). Less information is available in other regions (e.g., Atlantic Ocean), but it is suspected, based on known threats and general declines reported for mobulid rays, that those populations are in decline as well. While wide-ranging movements and migration possibly connect regions and steep local declines may reflect a global population reduction, caution is needed extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction, especially as the Spinetail Devil Ray has a widespread global distribution which likely includes some areas of lower fishing pressure (e.g., Australia and New Zealand). Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected that the Spinetail Devil Ray global population has undergone a reduction &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (48 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2025â€“2073) due to ongoing demand for high-value products. The Spinetail Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2bd+3d).This species was assessed as Endangered (EN) in 2018. However, improved data on population trends across regions has confirmed that the species warrants a CR status (i.e., had this information been available in 2018, the species would have been assessed as CR). However, the threats to this species have also been increasing in recent years, particularly through increased pressure from international trade in gill plates.","The Spinetail Devil Ray is primarily used for its dried prebranchial appendages (commonly called gill plates) and meat (Palacios et al. 2024). This species is the top landed and traded mobulid species for its meat, and the most traded for its gill plates worldwide (Palacios et al. 2024). However, in some regions, mobulid liver, cartilage, intestines, and fin tips may also be utilised for human consumption (Steinke et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2024, Acebes and Tull 2016, White et al. 2006, Piovano and Gilman 2017), likely as a by-product of the gill plate and meat trade. In some countries, Spinetail Devil Ray meat is also used for animal feed and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Ender and Fernando 2014, Lewis et al. 2015, Croll et al. 2016, Palacios et al. 2024, F. Doumbouya, pers. comm. 11/10/2015). In Peru, the skin is sometimes removed and dried with other fish products to make fertilizers for plants (Rojas-Perea et al. 2025).Mobulid gill plates are extracted in at least 14 countries and exported across Asia and Africa by land, air, or sea (Palacios et al. 2024). South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Singapore and Thailand are the major destinations for gill plates (Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Croll et al. 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2024). Gill plates are used for Chinese health tonics and fetch prices of 4.8 to 1,260 USD/kg with an average price of 511.81 USD/kg (Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2024). Since 2013, Hong Kong SAR and mainland Chinaâ€™s gill plate markets have shifted from physical storefronts to mostly online platforms, making tracking more challenging (Palacios et al. 2024). Spinetail Devil Ray gill plates are one of the four most traded mobulid species along with the Oceanic Manta Ray (M. birostris), Sicklefin Devil Ray (M. tarapacana), and Bentfin Devil Ray (M. thurstoni) (Zeng et al. 2016, Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2024).Spinetail Devil Ray meat is considered medium to low quality in most regions and is not believed to drive target fisheries (Palacios et al. 2024). Mobulid meat is traded predominantly for human consumption and may be eaten fresh, but is usually frozen, salted, or sun-dried (Palacios et al. 2024). It is consumed in at least 35 countries and traded mostly at a domestic level in South America, Africa, and Asia (Palacios et al. 2024). Mobulid meat consumption in Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Bangladesh, and the Philippines is connected to cultural traditions, and this local consumption is often the main driver of utilization (Palacios et al. 2024). For example, in Peru, mobulid meat is consumed both dried and fresh, but there is no apparent marketing or sale of gill plates (Ayala and Romero 2016, Alfaro-Cordova et al. 2017, Rojas-Perea et al. 2025). However, in the Republic of the Congo, where mobulid meat is also consumed locally in the vicinity of the landing sites, there are also â€œluxury goodsâ€ traders at the landing sites, with gill plates comprising part of their business (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2025). Globally, there are at least ten countries exporting mobulid meat, trading across land and sea to five major destination countries (Myanmar, mainland China, Thailand, Peru, and United Arab Emirates) (Palacios et al. 2024).There are some isolated reports of Spinetail Devil Rays being winged (pectoral fins removed), but in most instances it is unclear how these are utilised (Acebes and Tull 2016, Piovano and Gilman 2017). Surveys with fishers in Margarita Island, Venezuela, indicate that they sometimes cut wing tips off mobulids and sell them as shark fins (L. Zambrano pers. comm. 15/02/2025), or that they are used as filler for shark fin soup (White et al. 2006). Indeed, an analysis of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Flora (CITES) Trade Database (2017â€“2023), highlighted examples of mobulid fin trade reported by Sri Lanka (1,030 kg), Yemen (2,222 kg), and Oman (88 kg) (CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC 2023). However, given the small number of reports, and lack of evidence of mobulid fins in the Hong Kong SAR markets, it seems more likely these shipments were a coding error in the CITES Trade Database (Palacios et al. 2024). Similarly, the CITES Trade Database documents several exports of mobulid skin from Sri Lanka to Hong Kong SAR (including Sicklefin Devil Ray). However, there is no evidence from researchers on the ground that these animals are being processed for this use in these countries (D. Fernando unpubl. data 2025), and, as with the fin trade records, it is suspected these records are a result of a coding error.Mobulid rays, including the Spinetail Devil Ray, are used in aquarium display tanks across several regions of the world including some Arabian/Persian Gulf countries, the USA, Europe, and Japan.",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Giant devil ray,"Albania, Algeria, American Samoa, Angola, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, China, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Fiji, France, French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Gibraltar (United Kingdom), Greece, Guam, Guatemala, Guernsey (United Kingdom), Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Honduras, Hong Kong, SAR, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jersey (United Kingdom), Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macao, SAR, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands (United Kingdom), Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint Helena and Dependencies (United Kingdom), Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Spain, Sri Lanka, State of Palestine, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Vanuatu, Viet Nam, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Western Sahara, Yemen"
Mobula munkiana,Vulnerable,"The Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray (Mobula munkiana) is a medium-sized (to 110 cm disc width) ray that is limited to shallow, tropical Eastern Pacific waters from the Gulf of California to Peru down to depths of 30 m. The Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray has an extremely low reproductive output with only one pup born per litter, and is therefore likely to have very low productivity incapable of withstanding and recovering from even very low levels of fishing mortality. Increasing international trade in gill plates has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored devil ray (Mobula spp.) fisheries. The species is a target of large artisanal fisheries in MÃ©xico and Peru, and is taken as bycatch of small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch likely unreported or aggregated and reported as Mobula spp. There are no current or historical estimates of the population size and trend of the Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray, and further information is required from throughout its range. Based on distribution data, high catchability due to its schooling behaviour, limited productivity, directed and targeted fisheries, ongoing demand in trade, and a dataset showing declines in devil ray sighting records around Cocos Island, it is suspected that the Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray may have been depleted in areas where significant fisheries or threats for mobulids exist. There are likely some refuges from fishing, for example in Ecuador's GalÃ¡pagos Marine Resources Reserve and while it should be noted that illegal fishing is an ongoing issue in the reserve, this refuge suggests that this species may not be at a level of extinction risk characteristic of some other mobuild rays. Overall, it is suspected that this species has undergone a reduction of ~30â€“49% over the last three generations (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018â€“2056). Therefore, the Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray is assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2d+3d).","The Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray is used for its meat, skin, cartilage, liver oil, and gill plates. The meat from mobulid rays, including the Munk's Pygmy Devil Ray, is often used locally or traded regionally for human consumption, animal feed, and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Croll et al. 2016). The cartilage, the skin, which is commonly used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles), and the gill plates are exported to Asia (Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Croll et al. 2016, Notarbartolo di Sciara et al. 2017). The gill plates in particular fetch high prices in Asia and are used for Chinese health tonics (Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,"Manta de monk, Munk's devil ray, Pygmy devilray, Pygmy Devil Ray, Smoothtail mobula","Aruba, Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Colombia, Costa Rica, CuraÃ§ao, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Virgin Islands of the USA"
Mobula tarapacana,Critically Endangered,"The Sicklefin Devil Ray (Mobula tarapacana) is a large (at least 370 cm disc width) ray that has a circumglobal but patchy distribution in temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic oceans. The species is primarily oceanic, with populations mostly occurring in areas of high upwelling-related productivity, but can also be found in coastal waters and to depths of 1,896 m. Little is known about its biology and ecology, although it is inferred from other Mobula species to produce a single pup every one to three years, and therefore, it is slow to recover from overfishing.Increasing trade in gill plates and meat has led to the expansion of largely unregulated and unmonitored mobulid ray (Mobula spp.) fisheries worldwide. The Sicklefin Devil Ray is captured as target and incidental catch in industrial and small-scale purse seine and gillnet fisheries, and is retained for its meat and gill plates. It is a large component of these fisheries in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and India, but across its global range, much of this catch remains unreported. The limited species-specific catch, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess population reductions. Where documented, Mobula catches and landings have steadily decreased despite stable or increasing fishing effort, indicating global populations have also declined. Since the 2000s, significant population reductions have been estimated, suspected, or inferred in many regions, including Southeast Asia, the Eastern Pacific, and the Indian Ocean, where mobulid rays are heavily exploited.Overall, the available data show severe population reductions of mobulid rays in several regions, with suspected local and regional reductions of 50â€“99% over the last three generation lengths (48 years). Less information is available in other regions (e.g., Atlantic Ocean), but it is suspected, based on known threats and general declines reported for mobulid rays, that those populations are in decline as well. While wide-ranging movements and migration possibly connect regions, and steep local declines may reflect a global population reduction, caution is needed when extrapolating regional declines to a global population reduction, especially as the Sicklefin Devil Ray has a widespread global distribution which likely includes some areas of lower fishing pressure (e.g., Australia). Nonetheless, based on current and future potential levels of exploitation, steep declining trends in monitored populations, and the uncertainty of data in some regions, it is suspected and inferred that the Sicklefin Devil Ray global population has undergone a reduction &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (48 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2025â€“2073) due to ongoing demand for high-value products. The Sicklefin Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2bd+3d).This species was assessed as Endangered (EN) in 2018. However, improved data on population trends across regions has confirmed that the species warrants a CR status (i.e., had this information been available in 2018, the species would have been assessed as CR). However, the threats to this species have also been increasing in recent years, particularly through increased pressure from international trade in gill plates.","The Sicklefin Devil Ray is primarily used for its dried prebranchial appendages (commonly called gill plates) and meat (Palacios et al. 2025). However, in some regions, mobulid liver, cartilage, intestines, and fin tips may also be utilised for human consumption (White et al. 2006a, Acebes and Tull 2016, Piovano and Gilman 2017, Steinke et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2025), likely as a byproduct of the gill plate and meat trade. In some countries, Sicklefin Devil Ray meat is also used for animal feed and shark bait (Fernando and Stevens 2011, Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Ender and Fernando 2014, Lewis et al. 2015, Croll et al. 2016, Palacios et al. 2025, F. Doumbouya, pers. comm. 11/10/2015). In Peru, the skin is sometimes removed and dried with other fish products to make fertilizers for plants (Rojas-Perea et al. 2025).Mobulid gill plates are extracted in at least 14 countries and exported across Asia and Africa by land, air, or sea (Palacios et al. 2025). South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Singapore and Thailand are the major destinations for gill plates (Heinrichs et al. 2011, Couturier et al. 2012, Croll et al. 2016, Notarbartolo-di-Sciara et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2025). Gill plates are used for Chinese health tonics and fetch prices of 4.8 to 1,260 USD/kg with an average price of 511.81 USD/kg (Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2025). Since 2013, Hong Kong SAR and mainland Chinaâ€™s gill plate markets have shifted from physical storefronts to mostly online platforms, making tracking more challenging (Palacios et al. 2025). The large size (average 25â€“30 cm total length), smooth lobe edging, and black and white (thick white centre) bicolouration of Sicklefin Devil Ray gill plates make this species easily identifiable in the gill plate trade (Stevens et al. 2025). These â€˜flower gillsâ€™ fetch the second highest price after manta ray (Oceanic Manta Ray (M. birostris) and Reef Manta Ray (M. alfredi)) gill plates and are one of the three most traded mobulid species; along with the Oceanic Manta Ray and Spinetail Devil Ray (M. mobular) (Zeng et al. 2016, Oâ€™Malley et al. 2017, Palacios et al. 2025).Sicklefin Devil Ray meat is considered low quality in most regions and is not believed to drive target fisheries (Palacios et al. 2025). Mobulid meat is traded predominantly for human consumption and may be eaten fresh, but is usually frozen, salted, or sun-dried (Palacios et al. 2025). It is consumed in at least 35 countries and traded mostly at a domestic level in South America, Africa, and Asia (Palacios et al. 2025). In Sri Lanka, whilst considered low quality meat, Sicklefin Devil Ray meat is the most valuable amongst mobulid rays (Blue Resources Trust pers. comm. 25/03/2025). Mobulid meat consumption in Peru, Guatemala, Mexico, Bangladesh, and the Philippines is connected to cultural traditions, and this local consumption is often the main driver of utilization (Palacios et al. 2025). For example, in Peru, mobulid meat is consumed both dried and fresh, but there is no apparent marketing or sale of gill plates (Ayala and Romero 2016, Alfaro-Cordova et al. 2017, Rojas-Perea et al. 2025). However, in the Republic of the Congo, where mobulid meat is also consumed locally in the vicinity of the landing sites, there are also â€œluxury goodsâ€ traders at the landing sites, with gill plates comprising part of their business (P. Doherty unpubl. data 2025). Globally, there are at least ten countries exporting mobulid meat, trading across land and sea to five major destination countries (Myanmar, mainland China, Thailand, Peru, and United Arab Emirates) (Palacios et al. 2025).There are isolated reports of Sicklefin Devil Rays being winged (pectoral fins removed), but in most instances it is unclear how these are utilised (Acebes and Tull 2016, Piovano and Gilman 2017). Surveys with fishers in Margarita Island, Venezuela, indicate that they sometimes cut wing tips off mobulids and sell them as shark fins (L. Zambrano pers. comm. 22/03/2025), or that they are used as filler for shark fin soup (White et al. 2006a). Indeed, an analysis of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Flora (CITES) Trade Database (2017â€“2023), highlighted examples of mobulid fin trade reported by Sri Lanka (1,030 kg), Yemen (2,222 kg) and Oman (88 kg) (CITES Secretariat and UNEP-WCMC 2023). However, given the small number of reports, and lack of evidence of mobulid fins in the Hong Kong SAR markets, it seems more likely these shipments were a coding error in the CITES Trade Database (Palacios et al. 2025). Similarly, the CITES Trade Database documents several exports of mobulid skin from Sri Lanka to Hong Kong SAR (including Sicklefin Devil Ray). However, there is no evidence from researchers on the ground that these animals are being processed for this use in these countries (D.

Nasolamia velox,Endangered,"The Whitenose Shark (Nasolamia velox) is a small (to 150 cm total length) requiem shark that occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from Baja California, Mexico, to Peru over the continental shelf to a depth of 192 m. It is captured in artisanal gillnet and longline fisheries and in industrial shrimp trawls throughout its range. Landings records of sharks from the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries, where gillnet fishing pressure is intense, indicate a decline in Whitenose Shark landings from 600 t in 1969 to 200 t in 2014 (with fishing ongoing). Targeted fisheries for sharks including the Whitenose Shark off Mazatlan were in operation by the early 1960s. In Guatemala in the 1990s, this was the second-most abundant shark in artisanal fisheries, but in 2006â€“2007 landings surveys, this species was encountered at lower levels, and two years of surveys from 2017â€“2018 only recorded two individuals. In Costa Rica, trawl surveys conducted between 2008 and 2012 failed to record the species even though it was present there in the 1980s. Catches in Colombia were relatively common in the 1990s, but it has rarely been recorded since. A few individuals were recorded in Peruvian landings in the late 1990s, but it has not been recorded since.Â Â Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific.Â Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, combined with an increasing rarity of records, limited biological productivity, and habitat degradation, the Whitenose Shark is suspected to have undergoneÂ a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generations (27 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.",This shark is retained and the meat is consumed locally.

Negaprion acutidens,Endangered,"The Sharptooth Lemon SharkÂ (Negaprion acutidens) is a large (to 340 cm total length) coastal shark that is widespread throughout the Indo-West and Central Pacific.Â It is demersal in shallow inshore and offshore waters to at least 90 m depth and is often found on and around coral reefs and on sandy plateaus near coral. It is also known to occur around and within mangrove forests, which may be used as nursery grounds. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small-scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and demersal trawl. This species is also threatened by declines in habitat quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices, and poor water quality; and mangroves from deforestation and coastal development. While there is limited species-specific data available, it is likely to have undergone declines based on its large size and presumably low productivity, and intensive coastal fisheries through much of its range. Landings surveys, dive surveys, diver interviews, and anecdotal evidence indicate substantial declines over the past three generations lengths (50 years). Results from baited remote underwater video system surveys of coral reefs across its range (242 reefs in 36 nations) indicate that the species has declined to very low levels through much of its range in Asia and Africa, but remains common in Australia, and in some island nations of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is estimated that the Sharptooth Lemon Shark has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the last three generation lengths (50 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.","The meat of the Sharptooth Lemon Shark is used fresh, dried, salted, frozen, or smoked.

It ranges from northern Mexico to Ecuador in the eastern Pacific. The species inhabits shallow inshore tropical and subtropical waters around coral reefs and mangrove fringes on continental and insular shelves from the surface to a depth of 92 m.

It has a very low fecundity (average 2 pups per litter per year) with a generation length estimated as 10 years. The species is heavily targeted for consumption by unregulated fishing activities, it is also illegally captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade, and subject to environmental impacts (mining, agricultural development) in the Amazon Region. The main threat is fishing pressure, with unsustainable targeting of the Discus Stingray having increased dramatically in the past 25 years along with an expansion of its fishing grounds along the Amazon River. In Brazil, a population reduction of at least 80% was estimated for the past three generation lengths (30 years). In the neighbouring countries, a very similar scenario probably is taking place since there is an increasing demand of the species for food consumption. This species has been indicated as one the potamotrygonins with the highest intrinsic susceptibility to extinction. Considering that the Discus Stingray is a fisheries targeted species and subject to habitat quality declines, and increasing environmental impacts including pollutants, it is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of at least 80% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). Thus, the Discus Stingray is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcde.","Since the Discus Stingray grows to considerable size, captures for ornamental purposes target neonates and juvenile specimens. The international ornamental aquarium trade of the Discus Stingray is considered very low when compared to other Potamotrygon species. The species is occasionally illegally exported to the ornamental aquarium trade from Brazil (AraÃºjo et al. 2004). It is also exported from Colombia and the main exporter is Peru (Prang 2020a). In the ornamental trade the species is known as Ceja and Manzana Ray and its trade codes are: P56, P57, R113, R114, R115, R116, R118, R119 (Ross and Schaffer 2000, Prang 2020a). The Discus Stingray is considered to have the highest meat-carcass ration of all potamotrygonins. It is captured and traded for consumption in local, national (Brazil), and international markets (Charvet-Almeida and Almeida 2008, AraÃºjo 2011, Camacho-Oliveira et al. 2020, Charvet et al 2022, Gama person. comm. 2021).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,"Ceja ray, Discus ray, Manzana ray","Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"
Potamotrygon albimaculata,Vulnerable,"The TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon albimaculata) is a small (up to 55 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the TapajÃ³s River basin in Brazil, primarily occurring in the main channel of the upper to middle TapajÃ³s River. The species' dorsal colour pattern makes it highly valued in the international ornamental aquarium trade. Mainly adults are targeted and have been illegally captured and traded from Brazil since the 1980s at levels of up to at least 15,000 individuals per year from 2000â€“2006, with ongoing high levels of capture and trade. The TapajÃ³s River basin region has been severely impacted by habitat degradation, including pollutants, in the past decades due to legal and illegal mining and agricultural activities which have occurred in almost 60% of this speciesâ€™ range. Thus, it is suspected that the TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population reduction of at least 30% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to significant habitat degradation, levels of exploitation, and pollutants, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cde.","The TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray has been captured for the international ornamental market for at least the past three decades and captures target mainly adult specimens. The species is considered of high commercial value in the international ornamental aquarium trade due to its dorsal color pattern (AraÃºjo 2004). The trade code for this species is P-14 and the trade common name is Itaituba Ray (Ross and Schaeffer 2000).Between 2000â€“2006, about 15,000 individuals of this species were illegally exported from Brazil, the species has been exported under incorrect names, such as Xingu Freshwater Stingray (P. leopoldi) or Henle's Freshwater Stingray (P. henlei) (M.L.G. AraÃºjo unpubl. data 2022). Currently, most individuals on the market come from Asian captivity breeding facilities (Prang 2020). Prior to this, broodstock were traded from Brazil, for example, in 2015â€“2017 many females were exported illegally from Brazil to Asian countries to be used as breeding stock in captive breeding facilities. Since 2017, illegal exports from Brazil have decreased since the ornamental market seemed to have shifted interest to hybrid morphs of Xingu Freshwater Stingray (P. leopoldi) and Pearl Freshwater Stingray (P. jabuti).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,The TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray,Brazil
Potamotrygon amandae,Least Concern,"The Amandaâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon amandae) is medium-sized species (to 65 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray with a relatively wide geographic distribution in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay, and mainly in the ParanÃ¡-Paraguay River basin. The species is expanding its distribution area, occupying new areas in the Upper ParanÃ¡ Region, southeastern Brazil, after natural barriers were removed. It is a low fecundity species (1â€“3 pups) that is targeted for the international ornamental aquarium trade and has been subject to negative fishery (tail mutilation and killing), mainly out of its native range of occurrence. It is also occasionally taken for consumption by local communities. Since this species has been expanding its native range of occurrence and seems to adapt well to new habitats, it has been considered an invasive species in some regions adjacent to its original distribution area, leading to a suspected population increase. Therefore, the Amandaâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Least Concern.","The species is targeted for the international ornamental aquarium trade. The skin of this species has also been tested by the shoe industry, but there is no updated data on this topic (D. Garrone-Neto pers. comm. 2022). Artisanal fishers, indigenous, and riparian people consume the species when it is accidentally caught.",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,The Amandaâ€™s Freshwater Stingray,"Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Paraguay"
Potamotrygon brachyura,Vulnerable,"The Giant Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon brachyura) is the largest Neotropical potamotrygonin freshwater stingray (up to 176 cm disc width and over 200 kg), endemic to the ParanÃ¡-La Plata River basin and found mainly in large floodplain rivers of northeastern Argentina, south central-west and south Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Its fecundity is relatively high compared with other potamotrygonins (average 8â€“10 pups per litter) but a low estimated maximum population increase rate of 0.15â€“0.19 per year. The Giant Freshwater Stingray is targeted in subsistence and commercial fisheries for its meat for human consumption. It is also targeted as a trophy fish in recreational fisheries and captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade. Environmental impacts and habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, livestock farming, pollution, urban and industrial development and droughts linked to climate change are also threats for the Giant Freshwater Stingray. In approximately one fifth of its distribution range, a steep population decline (90%), mainly due to fishing pressure, has been estimated over the past three generation lengths (59 years). In the remaining distribution range of this species, fishing pressure is lower yet ongoing. Considering this and combined with life history traits that make it susceptible to overexploitation, an overall population reduction of at least 30% is inferred over the past three generation lengths (59 years), leading the Giant Freshwater Stingray to be assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2bcde). Nevertheless, additional, more specific data on population trends, or the increase, or development of some of the currently potential habitat modification threats (e.g., dam construction, waterway development) will require the Giant Freshwater Stingray to be reassessed in the near future.","The Giant Freshwater Stingray is targeted in subsistence and commercial fisheries for its meat, which is used for human consumption. It is also targeted as a trophy fish in recreational fisheries, and captured for the international aquarium trade. The Giant Freshwater Stingray is caught mainly for human consumption throughout almost all of its range, with the highest levels of commercial fishing pressure in the Middle and Lower ParanÃ¡ River. In that region, the species is targeted during spring and summer (November to March) by commercial fishers, using specially-designed longlines (Castello and Jones 2016). The stingrays caught are all dressed in the field, conserved on ice, and sold to fish mongers in the domestic market.Â Giant Freshwater Stingray meat is routinely offered to the public in fish markets, bars and restaurants in the main riverine cities (e.g., Santa Fe, Rosario, ParanÃ¡), during summer (L.O. Lucifora, pers. obs. 2024). Juveniles are normally released alive by fishers, but subadults are retained, as they are perceived as â€œlarge enoughâ€. In general, this fishery catches almost exclusively the Giant Freshwater Stingray. However, occasionally, large individuals (&gt;60 cm disc width) of the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) are also taken, retained, and sold. In other areas of its geographic range, the Giant Freshwater Stingray is caught in subsistence and commercial fisheries (Castello and Jones 2016, Torres and Charvet 2024). These areas include parts of Argentina (other than the Middle and Lower ParanÃ¡), as well as areas in all other countries where the species occurs. Fishing pressure in these areas is presumably lower than in the Middle and Lower ParanÃ¡ (Scarabotti et al. 2021); nevertheless, its effects on the Giant Freshwater Stingray is ongoing and needs to be further evaluated.The Giant Freshwater Stingray is also caught for recreational fishing throughout its range using rod and reel (Castello and Jones 2016). It is sought after by recreational fishers as a trophy fish, because of its large size, which makes it the biggest fish in the ParanÃ¡-La Plata River basin and one of the largest freshwater fishes of South America, and because of the challenge it represents when caught by rod and reel. Some of the Giant Freshwater Stingrays caught by recreational fishers are released alive; however, many are killed and retained for consumption. There are no studies on the survival rates of Giant Freshwater Stingray after capture and release. Juvenile Giant Freshwater Stingrays and all life stages of other freshwater stingrays are also caught by recreational fishers targeting smaller bony fishes. In Argentina, there are two companies specialized in the recreational fishing of the Giant Freshwater Stingray (Castello and Jones 2016). The Giant Freshwater Stingray is occasionally captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade. There are no reliable or official numbers on quantities exported but captures target mainly neonates and juveniles probably in small quantities due to the large size this species attains. The trade codes for Giant Freshwater Stingray in the aquarium trade are R097 and S65976-3 (Ross and Schaffer 2000). Giant Freshwater Stingray specimens have also been traded under the name Maracaibo River Stingray (Potamotrygon yepezi) applying the trade codes R058 and S66103-2 (Prang 2020).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,Giant freshwater stingray,"Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay"
Potamotrygon constellata,Data Deficient,"The Rough Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon constellata) is a medium-sized (to at least 55 cm disc width) and poorly-known Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to South America where it occurs in the Amazon River and its affluents through Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil. There is uncertainty about its taxonomic validity due to morphological similarities with other species. Consequently, the speciesâ€™ potential full range and threats are poorly-known. It is suspected it may be taken as bycatch and used for human consumption, and subject to habitat degradation based on its known range. There is no information on its presence in the international ornamental aquarium trade. Since it is unknown if the fishing pressure or threats to habitat quality are causing a population reduction, there is currently inadequate information to assess the Rough Freshwater Stingray beyond Data Deficient.","The species is suspected to be used for human consumption, while there is no information on the use of this species for international ornamental aquarium trade. In Ecuador it is likely that, like other Potamotrygonidae rays, their stings are used as spurs for fighting cocks by native peoples of the Kichwa ethnic group (Guarderas and JÃ¡come-Negrete 2013).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,Thorny river stingray,"Brazil, Colombia"
Potamotrygon falkneri,Least Concern,"ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon falkneri) is a medium to large-sized (up to 68 cm in disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray widely distributed in the ParanÃ¡ Basin and Upper Amazon Basin in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Peru. This species has shown the ability to invade and proliferate in areas in the Upper ParanÃ¡ River which are heavily impacted by dams when natural barriers were removed. The species has an average fecundity of two pups per litter with a five-month gestation period observed in captivity. The main use of ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is for the international ornamental aquarium trade but it is also occasionally taken as a food source and exploited only in parts of its rather large geographic range. ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is threatened mainly by habitat degradation and loss but has shown its ability to occupy new areas with a range extension in the upper ParanÃ¡ River after dam constructions. Unregulated and illegal fishing for the ornamental aquarium trade, negative fishery, infrastructure development in part of its range, and climate change effects could also be considered threats for this species. However, the only area where the species is common and population trends have been estimated for freshwater stingrays as a group, the population trend for ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is stable. Therefore, given its large geographic distribution range, its apparent ability to withstand river damming, evidence of a range expansion, and apparently stable population trend where it has been studied, ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Least Concern.","The main use of ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is for the international ornamental aquarium trade but it is also occasionally taken for consumption. It enters the international ornamental aquarium trade mostly from Peru, although small numbers have been exported from Argentina, and the species has also been observed in domestic pet shops in Paraguay (Kyne and Lucifora 2022). This species is also captured and exported from Brazil and Uruguay (Ross and Schaffer 2000). In Brazil, this species was never included in the export quota system for freshwater stingrays.In the ornamental trade, ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray is exported under the names Potamotrygon castexi (junior synonym of P. falkneri, under trade codes P25, P31, P32, P34, P54, R056, R057, R110, R143, R154, S65969, S65972, S65973, S65994, S65997), Potamotrygon cf. garrapaÂ  (a synonym of Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (P. motoro), trade codes R035, S66096-4) and as P. falkneri (trade codes P53, R142, S65996) (Prang 2020a). ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray has been exported mainly to Europe but also to the United States of America market, with prices in Europe (United Kingdom, Germany and Czechia) ranging from USD 120â€“2,737 (Prang 2020b).

Potamotrygon henlei,Vulnerable,"Henleâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon henlei) is a medium to large (up to 71 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the Tocantins-Araguaia River basin in Brazil. This species has an average fecundity of four pups per litter. It is one of the species captured for the international ornamental trade and may be considered as belonging to the valued â€˜black raysâ€™ group. The range of this species overlaps one of the most anthropogenically impacted regions in the Brazilian Amazon basin, and comprises a great portion of the Cerrado savanna biome, which is also strongly subject to agriculture and livestock farming. Henleâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is subject to various threats, mainly comprising fisheries (bycatch, ornamental, recreational, and negative), habitat loss and degradation, intense damming, mining, agricultural and urban expansion, and climate change. Considering this scenario, a population reduction of at least 30% is suspected over the past three generation lengths (33 years), due to a decline in habitat quality and fishing pressure. Thus, the species is assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2cde).","Similarly to some areas in the Amazon Basin, freshwater stingrays are not traditionally taken for food purposes and therefore, Henleâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is not a target species in the Tocantins River region. Nevertheless, this species is frequently captured as bycatch in other fisheries and subject to tail mutilation (negative fishery sensu Compagno and Cook 1995) before being released back to the water.Â This species has been historically present in the international ornamental aquarium trade since the late 1980â€™s and 1990â€™s with varying demand from the market. Wild caught individuals of this species have been exported under a species-specific and maximum disc width size limit quota system established by the Brazilian government in 2003. The main market is North America and Europe, with especially the albino and hybrids varieties being most valued (reaching up to USD 4,500 per individual) (Prang 2020a,b). Despite not being commonly present in the Asian markets, between 2014â€“2016, Thailand became the main importer while England was the main importer in Europe (Prang 2020a,c). The trade codes for this species are P12 (this specific one also known as â€˜King Henleiâ€™ and the most valued dorsal color patterns), R037, R038, R040, and R041 (Ross and Schaeffer 2000). There is one specific hybrid obtained from the breeding of Xingu Freshwater Stingray (Potmatotrygon leopoldi) with a predominantly black dorsal color (very few whitish spots) and Henle's Freshwater Stingray that is referred to as the â€œBlack Rayâ€ morph in the ornamental trade. Henleâ€™s Freshwater Stingray belongs to the â€˜black rays' color group, along with the Xingu Freshwater Stingray and TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray (P. albimaculata). Henle's Freshwater Stingray has also been indicated as belonging to the â€˜black raysâ€™ color group along with the Great Freshwater Stingray (P. rex) (Carvalho 2016), however, this is not a consensus among ornamental fish traders. Since 2018, the market interest for Henle's Freshwater Stingray and TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray appears to have declined, particularly after the introduction of the Suriname Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon boesemani) and Marques' Freshwater Stingray (P. marquesi) to the market (Prang 2020c). Between 2005 and 2010, the highest interest was in larger individuals (parental stock), although market demand was lower than for Xingu Freshwater Stingray. The number ofÂ Henle's Freshwater Stingray individuals seized (between 2002â€“2018) accounted for less than 2% of the total quantities seized (Prang 2020b). Hybrids of Henle's Freshwater Stingray are predominantly sold in North America, with prices ranging from USD 700 to USD 900 each, while some of the albino variations can reach around USD 4,500 each (Prang 2020b).

Potamotrygon histrix,Near Threatened,"The Porcupine Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon histrix) is a small (to 52 cm disc width (DW)) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the ParanÃ¡-La Plata River Basin and distributed in a relatively limited geographic range (less than 4,000 km of river length) across Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. There is scarce information on its biology. Adult females ranged from 33â€“36 cm DW with fecundity varying between 6â€“9 pups per litter. Its intrinsic susceptibility to extinction was estimated to be lower when compared with other potamotrygonins. This species is rarely used for human consumption, and enters the international ornamental aquarium trade in limited numbers. The Porcupine Freshwater Stingray is mainly threatened by environmental impacts, mostly driven by agricultural development, with its entire range in one of the main agriculture areas for growing soybeans. Its range lies entirely within a major waterway of paramount economic importance, which may soon be further impacted by large infrastructure development. Therefore, the habitat of this species is under ongoing modification and may suffer from large-scale degradation. This species is also subject to urban development, bycatch, and negative fishery. Climate change effects that may alter the hydrological regime throughout its distribution area are of concern for this species. Considering the existing threats to which the species is subject and its biological features, a population reduction of at least &gt;20% is suspected over the past three generation lengths (22 years). Therefore, this species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2ce).","The Porcupine Freshwater Stingray is rarely taken as a food source but is captured as bycatch in other fisheries. Given its small size, the species is rarely sought after for its meat but it is reported to be captured with harpoons (Soto et al. 2009). It may be taken as bycatch in longlines (for other stingrays, but also for other fishes, such as 'dorado', Salminus brasiliensis, and 'surubim', Pseudoplatystoma spp.), and in much smaller numbers in gillnets. Furthermore, the Porcupine Freshwater Stingray is an incidental catch by recreational fishers and often has its tail mutilated or is not released alive back to the river (negative fishery, sensu Compagno and Cook 1995).The Porcupine Freshwater Stingray is occasionally captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade but is taken in limited numbers (Ross and Schaffer 2000) and predominantly targeting only the more attractive dorsal color patterns. The name Potamotrygon histrix is commonly found in the international ornamental aquarium trade under the label â€œhistrixâ€ or â€œhystrixâ€, however, in most cases these names correspond to other species, such as Wallace's Freshwater Stingray (P. wallacei), Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (P. orbignyi), and YepÃ©zâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (P. yepezi) (Ross and Schaffer 2000, Prang 2020a), and also as False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (P. humerosa) and Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray (P. scobina).

Potamotrygon humerosa,Near Threatened,"The False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon humerosa) is a small (to 33 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater ray. It is endemic to Brazil where it has a patchy distribution and is mainly associated with the Amazon River's tributary confluence areas. It is a low fecundity species (average of two pups/litter), with a gestation period of 3â€“4 months and an annual reproductive cycle. The estimated generation length is 7.5 years. The False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray has been illegally traded in the international ornamental aquarium market, often under the name of other reticulated potamotrygonin species. Increasing tourism and urban development threaten the species due to habitat degradation and negative fishing. Bycatch is also a threat present in most areas of its distribution. These threats associated with its reproductive parameters led to a suspected population reduction of approximately 20% in the past three generations length (23 years) due to levels of exploitation, a decline in habitat quality, and pollutants. The causes of this population reduction are still increasing and conservation strategies remain lacking. The False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray is precautionarily assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2cde).","The False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray has been illegally exported from Brazil and is present in the international ornamental aquarium trade, sometimes under the names Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon orbignyi) and Marques' Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon marquesi) (Ramos 2017, M.L.G. Araujo unpubl. data 2023). Approximately 10% of all Reticulate Freshwater Stingray specimens exported from ParÃ¡ corresponded to the False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (M.L.G. Araujo unpubl. data 2023). In the international ornamental aquarium trade, the False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray has been identified under the codes P061, R061 R062, R065, R066, R067, R063, R148 (Ross and Schaeffer 2000). The market price varies between USD$180/individual (European market) to USD$340/individual (USA market) (Prang 2020). There have been some trade codes incorrectly applied to the False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray, which actually correspond to other reticulated species such: Marques' Freshwater Stingray(or â€œMosaic Rayâ€, P46, R146), Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (R064) and Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon schroederi) (P10, R124). Likewise, False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray has also been misidentified as the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (R078, R081) and Marques' Freshwater Stingray (P23, R122).This species is only taken as a food source when other options are not available due to its relatively small size, however, there is a constant increasing tendency to have freshwater rays taken as food source throughout the Amazon Basin. Therefore, this species is used as food source but not as intensively as other potamotrygonins, such as Paratrygon species. Occasionally the species is taken for its liver oil, which is used as a traditional medicine mainly for respiratory diseases and birth deliveries (Rosa et al. 2010).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,The False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray,Brazil
Potamotrygon jabuti,Endangered,"The Pearl Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon jabuti) is a medium-sized (up to 55 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the tributaries of the upper to middle TapajÃ³s River in Brazil. The species' dorsal colour pattern makes it highly esteemed in the national and international ornamental aquarium trade. Adults have been illegally captured and traded in high numbers since the 1990s and this species has been estimated to account for 35% of the ornamental stingray seizures by the Brazilian Government between 2002 and 2018. The TapajÃ³s River basin region has also been severely affected by habitat degradation in recent decades driven by legal and illegal gold mining activities across almost 70% of the species range. These mining activities alter physicochemical habitat conditions such as turbidity and dissolved oxygen, and cause exposure to elemental mercury used in the extraction process. Moreover, agriculture expansion has led to deforestation and further habitat degradation pressure as it deteriorates environmental conditions by subjecting the species to pesticides and fertilizers runoff and water silting. Thus, considering the combined effects of exploitation levels and habitat degradation, it is suspected that the Pearl Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population reduction of at least 50% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) and therefore, is assessed as Endangered (A2cd).","The Pearl Freshwater Stingray has been illegally captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade at least for the past three decades with the trade targeting mainly adult specimens ( â‰¥39 cm disc width). The species is one of the most valued species in the international ornamental aquarium trade due to its dorsal color pattern (AraÃºjo 2004). The trade code for this species is R080 and P54 with the trade common name Jabuti Pearl Ray (Ross and Schaeffer 2000).Â Juveniles of this endemic species have been illegally exported from Brazil as the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) due to their similar ocellated dorsal color pattern. From 2003 to 2009, approximately 22,000 Pearl Freshwater Stingray specimens were illicitly exported from Brazil (AraÃºjo 2004, M.L.G. AraÃºjo unpubl. data 2022). It has been estimated that the Pearl Freshwater Stingray accounted for 35% of the stingrays seized by the Brazilian Government between 2002 and 2018 (Prang 2020). Currently, the species continues to be illegally exported (approximately 1,000â€“1,500 individuals per year) for captive breeding mainly in Asian and European facilities, including for the breeding of attractive hybrid color patterns. Female stingrays exported from Brazil to Asian countries have been used to produce hybrids withÂ  Ocellate Freshwater Stingray, Tapajos Freshwater Stingray (P. albimaculata), Marquesâ€™ Freshwater Stingray (P. marquesi), and Xingu Freshwater Stingray (P. leopoldi) (M.L.G.

Potamotrygon leopoldi,Vulnerable,"The Xingu Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon leopoldi) is a medium-sized (to 72 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the Xingu River basin in Brazil. It is known only from freshwater habitats and in the Xingu River clearwater basin there is predominance of dark basaltic rocky substrates alternating with sandy stretches and river rapids. The species' dorsal colour pattern makes it highly valued in the international ornamental aquarium trade. Juveniles are captured for the ornamental trade, while adults have been increasingly captured for human consumption or are subject to persecution in some areas due to fear of sting injuries. The Xingu River basin region has been severely impacted by habitat degradation and fragmentation in the past two decades due to the construction of a dam in the mid-Xingu River, with plans to build other upstream impoundments, and legal and illegal mining, agricultural and livestock activities, deforestation, and climate change. A Brazilian ornamental trade quota system was established in 2003 for the Xingu Freshwater Stingray to regulate the ornamental exports from Brazil; however, weak compliance and enforcement has led to ongoing illegal captures. Despite being bred in captivity mainly in the Asian region to generate more valuable hybrid colour patterns, the demand for wild-caught specimens has not ceased. This species has some refuge from fishing pressure in limited parts of its range in environmental protected areas, mainly in headwater regions. A demographic analysis considering population structure, growth parameters, and mortality estimated at least a 60% reduction in the population over the past three generation lengths (21 years). While many parts of the species' range are subject to environmental and anthropogenic threats, the demographic analysis considered that the entire range was exposed to these threats, whereas the species has refuge in some areas. Thus, it is inferred that the Xingu Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (21 years) due to levels of exploitation and increasing and significant habitat degradation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable (VU A2bcd).","The species is considered of high commercial value in the international ornamental aquarium trade (Araujo et al. 2004a, Charvet-Almeida 2006, Ramos et al. 2015). It is also used for human consumption with an increase in the captures of adult specimens for human consumption (Charvet-Almeida 2006), which are also being sold in regional restaurants (Y. Torres and P. Charvet pers. obs. 2021). Occasionally, the Xingu Freshwater Stingray is used for folklore medicinal purposes (mainly liver oil) (Charvet-Almeida 2006). The stings are regionally used by indigenous native populations as decoration elements. The traditional use of stings as combs to remove lice and lice eggs has also been observed. Stings have also been used as a negative element in regional religious rituals (Y. Torres and P. Charvet pers. obs. 2021).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Xingu river ray,Brazil
Potamotrygon limai,Near Threatened,"The Madeira Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon limai) is a medium-sized (to 66 cm disc width) freshwater stingray endemic to the Amazon River basin, where it has been recorded only from the upper Madeira River basin, at Jamari River, in an area associated with the Samuel Hydroelectric Dam. A significant decline has been observed in population numbers of this species and fish diversity has also declined in the basin following the construction of the dam and associated forest conversion to grazing pasture, due to soil and water contamination. Fishing is not a threat to this species, as most of the fisheries of this area have been moved to the upper reaches of the Dam and fishers do not capture this species. Taking a precautionary approach, which considers the recent drastic declines in habitat quality in its range, it is suspected that the Madeira Freshwater StingrayÂ has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) due to a decline in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2bc).",The use and trade patterns of this species are unknown.,SPECIES,Appendix III: ,The Madeira Freshwater Stingray ,Brazil
Potamotrygon magdalenae,Near Threatened,"The Magdalena Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon magdalenae) is a small (to 48 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the Magdalena-Cauca and Atrato basins in northern Colombia. It is known only from freshwater habitats. It is heavily fished for the national and international ornamental aquarium trade, being one of the most highly traded freshwater rays from Colombia with juveniles captured for the ornamental trade. Adults are targeted and taken incidentally for human consumption. The Magdalena-Cauca and Atrato basins region has been severely impacted by habitat degradation and fragmentation in the past four decades due to dam construction, agricultural activities, deforestation, mining, and drying up of swamps and hydrological changes. Genetic population structure is apparent throughout the speciesâ€™ range with the presence of geographic barriers that could isolate populations and decrease the resilience of the species. Thus, it is suspected that the Magdalena Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation and significant habitat degradation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened, close to meeting Vulnerable A2cd.","The Magdalena Freshwater Stingray is valued in the national and international ornamental aquarium trade and between 2003â€“2012 was the first or second most exported Potamotrygon species in Colombia (SÃ¡nchez-Duarte et al. 2013). Juveniles of this species are mostly used in the ornamental trade. Traders consider that there are two morphs (red and black) of the species in the Magdalena basin, but only the black ones (lower basin) are of interest for the ornamental trade. The meat of adults is also used for human consumption, although consumption is occasional, local, and mainly in the upper basin (i.e., Betania reservoir) (MejÃ­a-Falla et al. 2016). At some times of the year when fishing for other species is very low, adults of the Magdalena Freshwater Stingray are captured for subsistence use (Lasso et al. 2012, Mojica et al. 2012).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,"Magdalena freshwater stingray, Magdalena river stingray",Colombia
Potamotrygon marquesi,Near Threatened,"Marques' Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon marquesi) is a medium-size (up to 59 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray with a possible patchy distribution across some of the SolimÃµes-Amazonas System tributaries. This species is found predominantly in muddy substrates, and is also considered to be territorial and sedentary. Marquesâ€™ Freshwater Stingray exhibits a low fecundity (average 2â€“3 pups per litter). It is caught as bycatch by demersal longline and shrimp trawl and has been illegally exported to the international ornamental aquarium trade since the 1990s. Habitat degradation caused by damming, dredging, deforestation, salinization, and buffalo farms are threats for this species. Populations have been suspected to have undergone a reduction of at least 20â€“25% over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Hence, Marques' Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Near Threatened A2cd.","Juvenile, subadult, and adult individuals of Marquesâ€™ Freshwater Stingray are targeted for the international ornamental trade. This species has been common in the international ornamental trade, being illegally exported since the late 1990s, mainly from Brazil (export centres include ParÃ¡, CearÃ¡ and Pernambuco states) and Peru (M.L.G. AraÃºjo and P. Charvet pers. comm. 2024). In the international ornamental aquarium trade, it has been misidentified as False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray or Marble Ray (Potamotrygon humerosa), Ocellate River Stingray or Mantilla Ray (P. motoro), Reticulate Freshwater Stingray or Mosaic Ray (P. orbignyi) and Potamotrygon sp. (Ross and SchÃ¤fer 2000). The reference codes (P-numbers system) for P. marquesi are P-08, P-19, P-20, P-21, P-22, P-24 (named â€œMarbel or Mantillaâ€); P-23, P-46 (named â€œMosaic Rayâ€) (Ross and Schaeffer 2000, Prang 2020). In the last ten years, it has been used to produce hybrid individuals with Pearl Freshwater Stingray (P. jabuti), Xingu Freshwater Stingray (P. leopoldi) and Ocellate River Stingray (P. motoro) (Prang 2020). In ParÃ¡ State, ornamental captures are concentrated in Cachoeira do Arari (MarajÃ³ Island, ParÃ¡ State) Brazil (Almeida 2008, M.L.G. Araujo unpubl. data 2024). Between 2008â€“2014, many Marquesâ€™ Freshwater Stingray were exported from Brazil under the name of Reticulate Freshwater Stingray or Mosaic Ray (P. orbignyi) (Prang 2020). During this period the number of individuals bred in captivity and the number of hybrids of this species increased in the international ornamental fish market. In AmapÃ¡ State, this species is not commonly used for ornamental trade or local food, however, it is captured as bycatch in shrimp and gillnets fisheries (Gama 2013, Gama and Rosa 2015). In Acre State, Marquesâ€™ Freshwater Stingray individuals are accidentally caught in gillnet subsistence fisheries and usually are discarded dead (S.V. Melo, person. comm. 2021). In the MarajÃ³ Island, it is occassionally taken for food whenever other better options are unavailable (P. Charvet pers. comm. 2024).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Marques' Freshwater Stingray,
Potamotrygon motoro,Least Concern,"The Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) is a small to medium sized (to 60 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray. It is the most widespread Neotropical freshwater stingray and occurs in several of the main South American river basins, including the Amazon, Orinoco, Essequibo, Tocantins-Araguaia, XingÃº, TapajÃ³s, Madeira basins and ParanÃ¡-La Plata regions. Moreover, this species was taken to Southeast Asia by the international ornamental aquarium trade, was released or escaped to wild habitats and became an invasive species in Indonesia and Singapore. In its natural habitat this species has an annual reproductive cycle and an average of 7 pups per litter. This species is targeted for human consumption and international ornamental trade purposes, and also subject to negative fishing. Similarly to other freshwater stingrays, this species is also exposed to several habitat degradation threats across its range. The fishing pressure and habitat degradation in some regions has led to some potential localised population declines, while in other areas the population is considered stable. However, due to its widespread distribution, only slight levels of overall population reduction of ~10â€“19% over the past three generation lengths (29 years) are suspected. Therefore, the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Least Concern.","The Ocellate Freshwater Stingray is targeted for consumption, being one of the most captured species in commercial fishing throughout the Amazon River and most major tributaries across the Amazon Basin. It is captured by different gears, mostly longline and seine nets, but also by trawling and spearing. Adult and subadult individuals predominate in catch composition. Captured fish are usually traded in Brazilian fish markets within the Amazon Region but are also taken to be traded as far as the southeast portions of Brazil, sometimes as marine skates and other Rajiformes (Camacho-Oliveira et al. 2020). This species has been exported to Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea) as Rajiformes, both as dried and frozen fillets (Araujo 2004, Charvet et al. 2022, Oliveira et al. 2023). Furthermore, the species is a target for the international ornamental aquarium trade, representing the most exported potamotrygonin species for ornamental purposes from Brazil (Duncan et al. 2010) and Colombia (Lasso et al. 2013). The species is identified in the ornamental market by the following codes: P1, P2, P3, P5, P32, P33, P34, P35, P36, P37, P38, P39, P40, P41, P44, P45, P46, P47, P48, P49 (Ross and Schaffer 2000). Furthermore, the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray is a target species for the production of hybrids with other potamotrygonin species, including Xingu Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon leopoldi), Pearl Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon jabuti), and Wallace's Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon wallacei) (Prang 2020a).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,Ocellate river stingray,"Argentina, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana [FR], Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Singapore, Suriname, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"
Potamotrygon ocellata,Data Deficient,"The MarajÃ³ Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon ocellata) is a rare and poorly-known Neotropical freshwater stingray that is currently considered endemic to Brazil. Only two specimens have been collected, and the holotype was lost during World War II, so there is only one specimen available. Its distribution is highly restricted as it is only known from two locations at the mouth of the Amazon River between ParÃ¡ and AmapÃ¡ states. Its maximum size is unknown since no adults have yet been reported and its biology remains unknown. Since the last Red List assessment, the uncertainty about its taxonomic validity persists, due to similarities with other species and only two records. Consequently, the speciesâ€™ potential full range and threats are undefined but its known range of occurrence comprises the very dynamic and habitat and fisheries impacted Amazon Estuary region. Its presence in the international ornamental aquarium trade or use for human consumption is unclear. However, it has a similar dorsal colour pattern to the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (P. motoro) and thus may be captured and traded under that species name. Therefore, due to taxonomic uncertainty and since it is unknown if the fishing pressure or threats to habitat quality are causing a population reduction, there is currently inadequate information to assess the MarajÃ³ Freshwater Stingray beyond Data Deficient.",There is no reported use of this species for the international ornamental aquarium trade or human consumption.,SPECIES,Appendix III: ,Red-blotched river stingray,Brazil
Potamotrygon orbignyi,Least Concern,"The Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon orbignyi) is small to medium sized (61 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray. It occurs in northern South America, in Amazon River tributaries, and in the Orinoco, Essequibo, Approuague, Surinam and Parnaiba River basins. The species has an annual reproductive cycle and low fecundity (average of two pups per litter). The Reticulate Freshwater Stingray is not among the highly targeted and valued species in the international ornamental aquarium trade but there is an ongoing demand for it. The main threat for this species is bycatch and negative fishing, mainly associated with fishing operations and tourism. As other Potamotrygonins, this species is subject to various habitat degradation threats in part of its range. Nevertheless, considering that this is a widely distributed species with the population in most of its range considered stable or not severely affected by fishing pressure, the population is suspected to have undergone a reduction of ~10â€“19% over the past three generation lengths (35 years), and the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Least Concern.","The Reticulate Freshwater Stingray is mainly captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade. The trade codes used for the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray are P11, R043, R073, R074, R075, R076, R077, R082 (Ross and Schaffer 2000). It has been noted that some that trade codes under other species names also correspond to the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray such as: P. dumerilii (synonym of Reticulate Freshwater Stingray) (P09, R071, P42, R072, P47, R068); False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (P. humerosa) (R064); Raspy River Stingray (P. scobina) (P7, R105), Schroeder's Freshwater Stingray (P. schroederi) (P040, P045, R028, R145), Maracaibo River Stingray (P. yepezi) (R59), Potamotrygon cf. yepezi (R55, R60, R140) and Potamotrygon sp. (P43, R029) (Prang 2020b). Between 2000â€“2006, it was reported that 74,961 individuals were exported from Colombia (Lasso et al. 2013). From Brazil, between 2003 and 2005, a total of 2,827 Reticulate Freshwater Stingray specimens were exported and then from 2008â€“2016, a total of 315 specimens were exported (Ramos 2017). According to the CITES trade database, in 2018, 6,100 Reticulate Freshwater Stingray individuals were exported with Brazil noted as the country of origin (CITES 2018), however, very probably these 2018 exports did not correspond entirely to the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray.There are some endemic species (i.e., Marque's Freshwater Stingray (P. marquesi) and juvenile specimens of TapajÃ³s Freshwater Stingray (P. albimaculata) that have their export prohibited but which have been exported as the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Ramos 2017, Prang 2020a).

It has a discontinued distribution in the Paraguay River basin and in part of the GuaporÃ© River. It is estimated to have a relatively short generation length of 7.5 years. Population sizes are possibly small. Habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation related to urbanization, farming, and pollutants pose major threats to this species. The Pantanal Freshwater Stingray has a relatively restricted distribution and has been subject to severe habitat alteration and degradation, and loss due to forest fires related to anthropogenic actions and climate change in the last few years and thus, a population reduction of at least 30% is suspected over the past three generation lengths (23 years). Hence, the Pantanal Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Vulnerable A2ce.",This species belongs to the Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) and Amanda's Freshwater Stingray (P. amandae) group.

Potamotrygon rex,Near Threatened,"The Great Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon rex) is a medium-sized (to 69 cm disc width) freshwater stingray endemic to the Tocantins River, Brazil. It has a low fecundity (three pups per litter) and is a caught as bycatch in small-scale subsistence and artisanal fisheries with a range of gears including gillnets and longlines. It is not retained for consumption but is often persecuted due to stinging accidents with humans (negative interactions), with the tails cut off or it is killed before being discarded back into the river. It is occasionally found in the international ornamental aquarium trade. The species is also subject to habitat loss and degradation due to the construction of five medium to large hydroelectric dams along the Tocantins River over the past five decades, which may result in fragmentation of populations of the Great Freshwater Stingray and degraded the water quality. There is no population trend information available but the fishing pressure, habitat degradation, and population fragmentation are very likely to be causing some level of population reduction. Thus, it is suspected that the Great Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population reduction of approximately 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (33 years) due to declines in habitat quality and levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable A2cd).",This species is occasionally found in the international ornamental aquarium trade.,SPECIES,Appendix III: ,The Great Freshwater Stingray,Brazil
Potamotrygon schroederi,Vulnerable,"Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon schroederi) is a medium-sized (to 60 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater ray from the Amazon Basin region, mainly in the upper-mid Negro River basin (Brazil) and in the upper-mid Orinoco River basin (Venezuela, Colombia). Although reasonably widespread within its known range, it is not a common species. The species has a low fecundity (average of two embryos) with an annual reproductive cycle. It is present in the ornamental fish trade, however, is not one of the most traded due to its high mortality rates once removed from the wild. Habitat degradation occurs throughout its range mainly by sand dredging and gold mining, which introduces pollutants that affect this species. The increase of tourist activities has led to a rise in negative fishery, also posing a threat for Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray. Considering its habitat specificity, life history characteristics, intense ornamental capture in at least part of its range, and habitat degradation and pollutants, Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is suspected to undergone at least a 30% population reduction in the past three generation lengths (24years). Therefore, it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cde.","Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is an ornamental species of freshwater stingray with a flower-like dorsal colour pattern and for this it is also referred to as â€œFlower Rayâ€, or â€œRosette Flower Rayâ€. Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray and Tiger Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon tigrina) are known to form a dorsal colour pattern group known as â€œRosettes Raysâ€ (Prang 2020). In the ornamental trade, the species is often misidentified as False Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon humerosa) (P10), Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro) (P04, R128) and Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon orbignyi) (Trade codes P04, P40, P45, R128, R145, respectively). The trade code for Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray corresponds to R151 (Ross and Schaffer 2000).Mainly juveniles and subadults are captured (AraÃºjo et al. 2005, Lasso et al. 2013). Despite being valued in the international ornamental aquarium trade, the post-capture mortality of the species throughout the productive chain is extremely high (~80% of all captured individuals) making it less attractive for commercialization (AraÃºjoÂ et al. 2005). In Colombia, Schroederâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is the third most exported species. However, a large part of the records from the InÃ­rida Region (Colombia) corresponds to individuals from Venezuela which are illegally exported to Colombia (Lasso and SÃ¡nchez-Duarte 2012, Lasso et al. 2013). Germany is the primary ornamental importer of this species (AraÃºjo et al. 2005, Lasso et al. 2013).

Potamotrygon scobina,Near Threatened,"The Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon scobina) is a medium-sized to large (to 69 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray with a confirmed distribution range in the white waters of the Amazon River channel and lower section of some of its main tributaries in Brazil, present mainly in its lower portion and in the Amazon Estuary. It is also possibly extant in the mid Orinoco River drainage in Colombia and Venezuala. Part of its range is influenced by seasonal salinity variations and it seems to tolerate some levels of salinity in its habitat. The Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray has sexual dimorphism and sexual and ontogenetic segregation have been observed. Fecundity varies between 1â€“16 (average 6) pups per litter, and it has a yearly reproductive cycle associated with the hydrological cycle. The Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray is targeted by artisanal fisheries for human consumption in parts of its distribution range, is taken as bycatch throughout its area of occurrence, is captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade, and has its liver oil extracted for regional medicinal purposes. This species is subject to a combination of threats that comprise fisheries for consumption, bycatch captures, and ornamental and negative fisheries. Environmental degradation, habitat reduction, and climate change effects are also considered threats for this species. Since the Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray has been often captured for human consumption in its core distribution area in the lower section of the Amazon drainage, and is subject to environmental impacts throughout its distribution range, a population reduction of at least 25% is suspected over the past three generation lengths (32 years). Therefore, the Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2cde).","The Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray is targeted by artisanal fisheries (mainly longlines) for human consumption in parts of its distribution range (mainly in the MarajÃ³ Bay and lower Amazon River area) and is taken as bycatch (mainly nets) throughout its distribution range. It is also captured to be traded in the international ornamental aquarium market, has its liver oil extracted for regional medicinal purposes, and sting used in religious rituals.Â The Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray was reported as one of the main stingrays captured in Amazon Basin for consumption along with Discus Stingray (Paratrygon aiereba), Ocellate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon motoro), and Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon orbignyi) (Ramos 2017). In the Amazon River mouth region (mainly MarajÃ³ Bay) this species is intensively captured as a food source, both for subsistence and to be traded in regional fish markets, to be prepared as a fish stew or fried (Charvet-Almeida 2001).Â Along with ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon falkneri), the Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray is marketed mainly in European countries but dorsal color patterns of ParanÃ¡ Freshwater Stingray are more valued since they more closely resemble Reticulate Freshwater Stingray patterns (Prang 2020). Some of the common names applied to this species in the international ornamental aquarium trade include: Picasso Stingray (P41, mainly in the USA market), BelÃ©m Ray (P7, Europe and mainly in Czechia and Germany), and Scobina Ray (P7, Europe and mainly in the Netherlands) (Ross and Schaffer 2000, Prang 2020). Juvenile specimens of Whitespotted Freshwater Stingray are commercialized under the name â€˜Potamotrygon reticulataâ€™ (= P. orbignyi) (Prang 2020).

Potamotrygon signata,Vulnerable,"The ParnaÃ­ba Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon signata) is a small to medium-sized (up to 60 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the ParnaÃ­ba River drainage, a semi-arid region in Northeastern Brazil, where most rivers are intermittent. Population and life history data are limited for this species. The main threats to this species include negative fishing pressure and bycatch. It is occasionally present in the international ornamental aquarium trade. Environmental impacts comprise erosion, silting, pollutants, and changes of water regime in rivers, due to damming, agricultural and urban expansion. Severe droughts, probably exacerbated by global climate change, tend to reduce and further restrict the species habitat in intermittent rivers. The ParnaÃ­ba Freshwater Stingray has a patchy area of distribution with a seasonal variation in a single river drainage in a semi-arid region, which is isolated from other river basins. The ParnaÃ­ba River drainage is subject to extreme fluctuations in hydrological cycle,Â possibly enhanced by climate change effects, within the species distribution range with overall reductions in freshwater flow of major tributaries (as high as 49â€“68%) observed over an approximately 50 year period. Exploitation and declines in habitat quality, including pollutants, lead to a suspected population reduction of at least 40% over the past three generation lengths (23 years). Thus, the Parnaiba Freshwater Stingray is assessed as Vulnerable A2cde.","The ParnaÃ­ba Freshwater Stingray fisheries are mainly incidental or correspond to negative fisheries (sensu Compagno and Cook 1995). Nevertheless, when captured, at least the stings and liver are often removed to be used (Moro and Rosa 2016).

Potamotrygon wallacei,Endangered,"Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon wallacei) is a small (up to 31 cm disc width) Neotropical freshwater stingray endemic to the Negro River basin in Brazil. It has high site fidelity to its preferred leafy substrate habitats in shallow acid waters with low oxygen levels. It is subject to fishing pressure for the international ornamental aquarium trade and to persecution in some of its distribution range due to fear of sting injuries. In 2015â€“2016, deforestation and forest fires events occurred in the region with the highest population density of this species and severely impacted the populations. This led to an observed reduction in maximum disc width size and age with a concurrent reduction in generation length from 5 years to 3.5 years. Therefore, it is suspected that the Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray has undergone a population decline of at least 66% over the past three generation lengths (11 years) due to exploitation and habitat degradation, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.","Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray has a brownish dorsal colour pattern and is not as valued as some other freshwater stingray (e.g., Xingu Freshwater Stingray Potamotrygon leopoldi, Henleâ€™s Freshwater Stingray Potamotrygon henlei). Nonetheless, its small size makes it very attractive to aquarium hobbyists with limited-sized tanks. It is also considered a difficult species to breed in captivity and hence of less interest to the Asian ornamental trade (AraÃºjo 2020). The species has a high socioeconomic importance for fishers in the Barcelos region since the purchase of Amazonian ornamental fish usually follows a joint sales model (AraÃºjo et al. 2005). In essence, if the exporter cannot provide an item of the order list (e.g., stingray), the whole negotiation may be called off for the more profitable and valuable species exported from the State of Amazonas (such as the Cardinal Tetra, Paracheirodon axelrodi) (AraÃºjo et al. 2005). So, despite not being highly desired by the ornamental market, due to this joint sales model, Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray is the main freshwater stingray species exported in the Amazon State in Brazil (AraÃºjo 1998).Â According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) records, the main markets for the species are Germany, the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and the south-eastern states of Brazil (AraÃºjo 2020). The Brazilian export quota policy introduced for this species in 2008 allowed it to be valued in the international ornamental fish market, and due to this, exporters from countries like Peru and Colombia started using the label â€œPotamotrygon hystrixâ€ or â€œColombian Hystrixâ€ (referring to Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray). However, these exports actually refer to the Reticulate Freshwater Stingray (Potamotrygon orbignyi). Therefore, when purchasing â€œhystrix,â€ importers are led to believe that they are buying Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray (known in the market as â€œTrue Hystrixâ€). Perhaps due to this confusion, in the CITES freshwater stingray export records, Peru and Colombia appear as exporting countries of Wallaceâ€™s Freshwater Stingray alongside Brazil (AraÃºjo 2020).

This is considered a low abundance and altitudinally limited species. It is a low fecundity species (average three pups per litter). FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez's Freshwater Stingray has been considered overfished since it is taken as a food source locally, regionally, and is exported, is captured for the international ornamental aquarium trade, and for its liver oil used for medicinal purposes.

Thus, considering that this species has been subject to overfishing, various and intense habitat degradation caused by anthropogenic-based activities in its core distribution range, a population reduction of at least 60% is inferred over the past three generation lengths (29 years).

This fishing method accounts for about 10% of the total catch for these species. The stingrays are caught in lagoons and streams using small, motorless wooden boats called â€˜cayucosâ€™. The artisanal fishing fleet operates daily along the coasts and river mouths of Maracaibo Lake, including mangrove lagoons and wetlands in the south. Commercial stingray fishing occurs in the Maracaibo Lake and its tributaries using wood and fiberglass boats powered by 40 HP outboard motors, locally named 'chalanas'. The main commercial fishing gear are the â€˜chinchorrosâ€™, or nets with mesh openings of 6.4 to 11.4 cm and shrimp hamlets (â€˜mandingasâ€™) with openings of 1.3 to 2 cm.Â Official records and unpublished observations specifically of FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez's Freshwater Stingray fishery in the Maracaibo Lake basin show that average annual catches were 38 mt per year from 1983 to 1989, rising to 463 mt per year from 1990 to 1999. Between 2000 and 2009, catches nearly doubled to 837 mt per year. This fishery has become a vital socio-economic activity in the region, leading to the processing and commercialization of its meat in retail and wholesale markets, including supermarkets. The fishing and trade of FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez's Freshwater Stingray are culturally and nutritionally important, as they support the preparation of traditional dishes like ""mojito,"" a popular meal in towns and communities near Maracaibo Lake (O. Lasso-AlcalÃ¡, unpub. data).Despite not being a highly valued species in the international ornamental aquarium trade, the importance of the FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez's Freshwater Stingray as an ornamental species has been reported by several authors (Lasso et al. 2013). The species is targeted to some extent and fishing methods comprise hand nets, beach nets, nylon lines with hooks, and cast nets using earthworms as bait (Lasso et al. 2013). Between 2005 and 2007, FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez's Freshwater Stingray was heavily captured in the CachirÃ­ (sub-basin of the LimÃ³n River) and Palmar Rivers, primarily at night during the dry and low water season, using flashlights and cast nets. Since the mid-1980s, Venezuela has had a market for this species in the ornamental aquarium trade, with prices ranging from USD 4â€“4.50 per individual (8â€“12 cm DW) (Lasso 2006). In 2013, the domestic price was 250 Bs.F (~USD 0.83) (Lasso et al. 2013), however, it is more valued internationally, mainly by specialized distributors and collectors in North America, Europe, and Asia (O. Lasso-AlcalÃ¡ unpub. data). In 2006, a Venezuelan company exported specimens to Germany and Japan, with sizes ranging from 12â€“45 cm DW, priced between USD 20 and USD 60 each (O. Lasso-AlcalÃ¡, unpub. data). It is important to note that the commercialization of this species as an ornamental fish is illegal under Venezuelan regulations (O. Lasso-AlcalÃ¡ unpub.data). In Colombia, this species is sometimes caught in subsistence fisheries in the mid-lower Catatumbo River Basin and is valued for its medicinal use, particularly the liver oil for treating asthma (Lasso et al. 2013). In Puerto Santander, it is occasionally captured for the ornamental trade, but in low numbers possibly due to low population abundance (Lasso et al. 2013).",SPECIES,Appendix III: ,Maracaibo river stingray,"Colombia, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"
Prionace glauca,Near Threatened,"The Blue Shark (Prionace glauca) is a large (to 380 cm TL) oceanic pelagic shark wide-ranging throughout tropical and temperate waters from the surface down to 1,000 m deep. The species has the highest known population growth rates among pelagic sharks; it matures young and has large litters. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, although most of the take is bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. Generally, Blue Sharks are retained for the fins, although the demand for meat is likely increasing. The steepest population declines have occurred in the North and South Atlantic, with lesser declines in the Indian Ocean, and increases in the Pacific. The weighted global population trend estimated a median decline of 7.3%, with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths (30â€“31.5 years). However, due to uncertainty in some of the regional estimated trends, inferred steep historic declines in the Mediterranean Sea, high levels of unregulated exploitation, and high levels of international trade in meat and fins, experts estimated a global population reduction of 20â€“29% over three generation and the Blue Shark is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).","The Blue Shark is the most prevelent species in the shark fin trade. It comprises the majority of shark fins imported in Hong Kong; 17.3% in 1991â€“2001 and 49% in 2014 (Clarke et al. 2006a, Fields et al. 2018). The meat is often discarded but demand may be increasing and it is used in some regions where it is sold fresh locally and frozen or dried for international trade (Ebert et al.Â 2013, Dent and Clarke 2015).",SPECIES,Appendix II:Listing adopted at CoP19 in November 2022 with entry into effect delayed by 12 months. ,Blue Shark,"Albania, Algeria, American Samoa, Angola, Anguilla (United Kingdom), Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bermuda (United Kingdom), Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands (United Kingdom), Chile, China, Christmas Island, Clipperton, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, CuraÃ§ao, Cyprus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Falkland Islands (Malvinas), Faroe Islands, Fiji, France, French Guiana [FR], French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar (United Kingdom), Greece, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guam, Guatemala, Guernsey (United Kingdom), Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, SAR, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Isle of Man (United Kingdom), Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jersey (United Kingdom), Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macao, SAR, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Montenegro, Montserrat (United Kingdom), Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Norfolk Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands (United Kingdom), Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Republic of Korea, RÃ©union, Romania, Russian Federation, Saint-BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Helena and Dependencies (United Kingdom), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (United Kingdom), Spain, Sri Lanka, State of Palestine, Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tokelau, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Turks and Caicos Islands (United Kingdom), Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Virgin Islands of the USA, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Western Sahara, Yemen"
Pristis clavata,Critically Endangered,"The Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata) is a large (to at least 318 cm total length) estuarine and coastal shark-like ray. Historically, it was found widely across the Indoâ€“West Pacific, but it is now â€˜possibly extinctâ€™ throughout its east Indian and Southeast Asian range, and is now only extant in Papua Province (Indonesia), Papua New Guinea, and northern Australia. It occurs in inshore shallow waters of 0â€“20 m depth, with juveniles occurring within estuaries, while adults are thought to mainly use coastal environments.It is taken as bycatch (and was historically targeted) in commercial and small-scale fisheries and often retained for its meat and fins. Historically, its fins were considered among the most highly valued in the shark fin trade. This drove demand and increased exploitation of the species over the past decades. Habitat loss and the morphology of the rostrum, which makes them susceptible to capture in fishing gear, have also driven declines independently of trade. International trade of all sawfish species was prohibited in 2007 and 2013 with their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), however, illegal trade continues (especially for their rostra, but in some regions also for their meat and fins). Throughout most of its range, this species is exposed to moderate to heavy fishing pressure, while habitat degradation has likely also impacted populations.Population declines are evident and likely severe in Papua Province (Indonesia) and Papua New Guinea, primarily due to intense gillnet fisheries pressure in estuaries and coastal areas. It is suspected that substantial declines in Dwarf Sawfish populations across all of northern Australia occurred prior to the 2000s. While population decline over the last three generations (63 years) is inferred for Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in recent years stabilization of declines or some recovery is likely to have occurred owing to reductions in fishing effort and spatial protections. Currently, the Kimberley region of Western Australia appears to be the most significant refuge for this species globally, due to spatial protections, extremely low commercial fishing activity, and low human population density. Within the last three generation lengths (63 years), declines are likely to still be ongoing throughout the Gulf of Carpentaria, particularly in Queensland, and it is likely that remnant populations of Dwarf Sawfish on the east coast of Queensland have almost depleted to local extinction. The species is likely extinct in east India, Malaysia, and western Indonesia, but it is not possible to determine the timing of possible extinction or that there are no remnant undetected populations and as such, it is suspected that steep population reductions have occurred in the western part of its historic range within the past three generation lengths (63 years). In its extant range in Papua Province (Indonesia), Papua New Guinea, and Australia, a population reduction of 70â€“75% is inferred over the past three generation lengths. Taken together, it is suspected that the Dwarf Sawfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the last three generation lengths (63 years) due to exploitation, habitat degradation, and reductions in extent of occurrence, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd).","The Dwarf Sawfish is likely to be retained when caught for consumption or for sale of the meat, fins, and rostra (except in Australia) (e.g., White et al. 2017a, Grant et al. 2021a, Grant et al. 2021b). Some communities in Papua New Guinea retain sawfish for cultural reasons, and rostra are routinely observed in houses of fishers for decorative purposes (Grant et al. 2021b). Anecdotal observations of rostra being sold in markets in Port Moresby indicate there is a domestic market for rostra, although no further information is available, and it is not considered that domestic trade of rostra is widespread (Grant et al. 2021a). Fins from sawfishes are sold to local fin buyers, and observations of legal and illegal market chains in southern Papua New Guinea indicate that fins likely enter global fin markets in East Asia (Busilacchi et al. 2021). Similarly, in Papua Province, Indonesia, this species is likely retained for consumption or sale of meat, fins, and rostra. There is presently no information on cultural uses and values of sawfishes in Papua Province.The Dwarf Sawfish has been protected in Australia since 2009, prohibiting any use or trade. Although ongoing retention of rostra still occurs, no data are available on the quantities. Prior to its national protection, the species was retained for sale of meat and fins, although this is not considered to currently occur on a large scale. Some Indigenous communities across northern Australia use sawfish for consumption and cultural purposes (e.g., McDavitt 2005). No data are available on the Indigenous catch; however, it is suspected to be localized, opportunistic, and low in volume (Kyne et al. 2013).",SPECIES,Appendix I: ,"Dwarf Sawfish, Queensland Sawfish","Australia, Papua New Guinea"
Pristis pectinata,Critically Endangered,"The Smalltooth Sawfish (Pristis pectinata) is a large (to 500 cm stretched total length) euryhaline shark-like ray with a widespread circumtropical distribution in the Atlantic Ocean with some population structure between the western and eastern Atlantic. The species occurs at depths of 0â€“122 m with juveniles occupying estuarine habitats and adults occurring in both estuarine and coastal waters. It is taken as bycatch (and was historically targeted) in commercial and small-scale fisheries, and often retained for its meat and fins. Historically, its fins were considered among the most highly valued in the shark fin trade, and this high value drove demand and increased exploitation of the species over the past decades. Habitat loss and the morphology of the rostrum, which makes them susceptible to capture in fishing gear, have also driven declines independently of trade. International trade of all sawfish species was prohibited in 2007 and 2013 with their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), however, illegal trade continues (especially for their rostra, but in some areas also for their meat and fins). The species is also listed on Appendix 1 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), which prohibits the taking of the species. Both the western and eastern Atlantic populations have undergone severe historic and ongoing steep population reductions due to overexploitation and habitat loss and degradation, with significant range contractions across their distribution. In the western Atlantic, the species is now extant in only four of its range states, with its 'presence uncertain' in 12 range states due to limited survey effort and few sightings, and it is 'possibly extinct' in three of its former range states. In the eastern Atlantic, of its former 18 range states, it is now extant in only five, has an uncertain presence in two, and is 'possibly extinct' in 11 states. Despite protection in some of its range states, threats are ongoing, and population decline is continuing. Due to limited abundance data, information on abundance trends was largely inferred from reports of capture records and local ecological knowledge, and this revealed populations have undergone high levels of decline over the past three generation lengths (59 years) in areas where it was historically extant, and is now either 'possibly extinct' or 'presence uncertain'. Only in the west Atlantic extant range states of the United States, some areas in Mexico, and the Bahamas are populations stable or increasing. Overall, it is inferred that the Smalltooth Sawfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (59 years) due to overexploitation, habitat degradation, and reductions in extent of occurrence, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd).","Despite species-level protections in many countries across the range of the Smalltooth Sawfish, the species is still used for the fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, liver, and skin (McDavitt 2005). Sawfish fins are among the most valuable in the shark fin trade and although international trade of sawfishes and their products is prohibited since 2007 and 2013 when they were listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix I, illegal international trade likely exists due to the high value of their products. Sawfish (Pristis spp.) fins have recently been reported from Hong Kong, albeit as a small proportion of fins sampled (CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020). In many parts of its range, the meat is generally consumed locally by coastal communities and does not usually enter the international trade, such as in the Bahamas (T. Guttridge pers. comm. 21 January 2022) and West Africa (R. Leeney unpubl. data 2022). In some West African countries, sawfish meat was the basis of a dish served as part of traditional ceremonies on the Bijago Archiplago, Guinea-Bissau (Leeney and Poncelet 2015). Sawfish rostra are used in traditional medicines, ceremonial weapons and as curios (McDavitt 2005). In West African countries, rostra were often kept by fishers and incorporated into local practices such as headdresses for ceremonial dances in Guinea-Bissau (Leeney and Poncelet 2015) or hung on the walls of a fisherâ€™s house as a decoration. The Smalltooth Sawfish is displayed in public aquaria.The use of sawfish rostral teeth for cockfighting spurs has been historically reported from PerÃº and other South American countries (Cogorno Ventura 2001), but recent reports highlight that this practice still occurs in Ecuador, PerÃº, Brazil, Bolivia, PanamÃ¡, and Costa Rica (Valerio-Vargas and Espinoza 2019, LÃ³pez-Angarita et al. 2021, P.

Pristis zijsron,Critically Endangered,"The Green Sawfish (Pristis zijsron) is a large (up to 730 cm total length) shark-like ray with an Indo-Pacific distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. The species occurs at depths of 0â€“100 m with juveniles occupying nearshore and estuarine habitats and adults occurring in deeper continental shelf waters. Sawfish fins are among the most highly valued in the shark fin trade. This high value and international demand incentivized increased exploitation and retention of this species. International commercial trade of all five sawfish species was prohibited in 2007 and 2013 with their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), however, illegal trade continues (especially for their fins and rostra). Habitat loss and the morphology of the rostrum, which makes them susceptible to capture in fishing gear, have also driven declines independently of trade. The Green Sawfish has undergone severe historic and ongoing population declines in most of its range due to overfishing and habitat loss and degradation, resulting in significant range contraction. The species is now â€˜possibly extinctâ€™ in 11 of its 36 range states, and its presence is uncertain in 11 range states. Based on limited catch data or information on abundance trends inferred from reports of capture records, and local ecological knowledge, populations have declined steeply over the past half century in most areas where it is still extant. Despite protection in at least five of its range states, threats are ongoing, and population decline is continuing. Overall, it is inferred that the Green Sawfish has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generation lengths (50 years) due to exploitation, habitat degradation, and reductions in extent of occurrence, and it is assessed as Critically Endangered (CR A2cd).","Despite species-level protections in many countries, sawfishes are still used for their fins, whole rostra, rostral teeth, meat, organs, and skin (McDavitt 2005). Sawfish fins are among the most valuable in the shark fin trade and although international commercial trade of sawfishes and their products was prohibited in 2007 and 2013 when they were listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), illegal international trade may still exist due to the high value of their products. For example, Green Sawfish were calculated to have a mean retail price of USD$14,392, and a maximum value of potentially USD$27,940 (McClenachan et al. 2016). Sawfish (Pristis spp.) fins have recently been reported from Hong Kong, albeit as a small proportion of fins sampled (CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020). The meat is generally consumed locally by coastal communities and does not usually enter the international trade. Globally, there is a small trade in live sawfishes including Green Sawfish for display in public aquaria that has been strictly regulated since their CITES listing (White et al. 2017b, Buckley et al. 2018). In Pakistan, rostra have been used for religious purposes and were once sufficiently abundant that they were used as boundary fences in some coastal villages (Khan 2021). In Bangladesh, sawfishes are targeted for use in medicinal purposes and command a high market price (Hossain et al. 2015, Haque et al. 2020). In Papua New Guinea, sawfishes have a range of uses including consumption, sale of fins and meat, use of rostra for decorations or weapons, and some communities use sawfishes for ritualistic purposes (Leeney et al. 2018, Grant et al. 2021a, Grant et al. 2021b).Historical use and trade of Green Sawfish is similar to other sawfish species and occurred throughout its range, but is perhaps best documented from the Arabian Peninsula (Moore 2015). The impressive rostra of this species, which exceeds 1m in length in large individuals, makes them highly valued as a curio. In Australia, the Green Sawfish has been protected since 2009, prohibiting any use or trade. Although ongoing retention and trade of rostra still occurs, no data are available on the quantities.

Pseudobatos buthi,Vulnerable,"The Spadenose Guitarfish (Pseudobatos buthi) is a small (to at least 69 cm total length) guitarfish endemic to the Gulf of California, Mexico in the Eastern Central Pacific. It is demersal on soft substrates in shallow coastal waters at depths of 0â€“10 m. The species was only recently described based on 80 specimens, and it is likely that the Spadenose Guitarfish is captured and misidentified as its regional congener, the Shovelnose Guitarfish (Pseudobatos productus). Thus, based on the catches and trends of the Shovelnose Guitarfish, the Spadenose Guitarfish is targeted by artisanal elasmobranch fisheries and taken as bycatch by commercial demersal trawls and gillnets, and retained for its meat and fins. There are no population trend data, however Mexican fisheries logbook data suggest fluctuating catches of all guitarfishes combined from 2007 to 2014 despite suspected stable effort. Declines have been noted in other species of sharks and rays in the Gulf of California artisanal fisheries and declines in guitarfishes are also likely. The actual levels of exploitation are high across the known spatial and depth range of the Spadenose Guitarfish, and it has no refuge from unmanaged fishing pressure. It is suspected that the Spadenose Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (27 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","There is no use or trade information for this species but its close relative and regional congener, the Shovelnose Guitarfish, is used for its meat and fins (Farrugia et al. 2016), and it is likely this species is also used for the meat and fins.",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,The Spadenose Guitarfish,Mexico
Pseudobatos horkelii,Critically Endangered,"The Brazilian Guitarfish (Pseudobatos horkelii) is a small (to 138 cm total length) shark-like ray that occurs in the Southwest Atlantic from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to northernÂ Argentina. It is demersal on soft substrates of the continental shelf inshore toÂ 150 m depth. It is captured in intense and largely unmanaged commercial and artisanal demersal trawl, gillnet, longline, and beach seine fisheries throughout its geographic range. There are three estimates of population reduction. First, in Rio Grande do Sul, total landings increased from 842 t in 1975 to 1,804 t in 1984 and then declined continuously to 157 t in 2001, the equivalent of a &gt;99% reduction over three generations (55.5 years). Second, the average research trawl catch-per-unit-effort of Brazilian Guitarfish in southern Brazil over the years 1993 to 1999 was 17% of that observed during 1975 to 1986, also the equivalent of a &gt;99% reduction over three generations.Â Fisheries remain intense and unmanaged there. Third, in Uruguay, this guitarfish is captured frequently in gillnets and longlines, is landed, and is sometimes targeted, and it is also captured in artisanal trawl fisheries. Catches from research trawls there in the 1980s and early 1990s were on average around 1,400 kg/hr, and between 2013 and 2017 were only 480 kg/hr, the equivalent of a &gt;92% reduction over three generations. In Argentina, it is suspected that intense and inadequately managed gillnet fishing pressure has led to declines in abundance there as well. Overall, due to intense and inadequately managed fishing pressure throughout its range, and steep population declines, it is inferred that the Brazilian Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (55.5 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","This guitarfish is utilized bycatch across its range, and in some areas is targeted (e.g. Silveira et al. 2018).

Pseudobatos lentiginosus,Vulnerable,"The Freckled Guitarfish (Pseudobatos lentiginosus) is a small (to 78 cm total length) benthic shark-like ray that occurs in the Western Central Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina, United States of America (USA) to Nicaragua including the Gulf of Mexico and in the Southwest Atlantic off Brazil to a depth of 30 m. Its sandy habitat is largely untrawled in the USA providing some refuge for this species. Elsewhere, it is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial trawl, handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged in parts of its range. For example, it is prevalent in Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries and is the third-most caught species in bycatch In the Mexican Caribbean. Although data are sparse in Central America and northern South America, fisheries there are intense in some areas and are largely unmanaged. In northern Brazil, unmanaged trawling and gillnetting has led to steep declines and local extinctions of several sharks and rays. Habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and oil exploration are also threats to this species in many parts of its range. Overall, due to the level of intense and unmanaged fishing pressure across its range, outside of USA waters, it is suspected that the Freckled Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (18 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.",Guitarfishes are typically utilised for their meat.

Pseudobatos leucorhynchus,Vulnerable,"The Whitesnout Guitarfish (Pseudobatos leucorhynchus) is a small (to 106 cm total length) shark-like ray that occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to northern Peru, including the southern Gulf of California and the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. It inhabits inshore areas with sandy substrates to a depth of 50 m. This guitarfish is captured in industrial demersal shrimp trawl fisheries and in artisanal gillnets and longlines. These fisheries are intense throughout most of its range. It is caught in low but increasing numbers in the southern Gulf of California multi-species artisanal gillnet fishery, which has been responsible for the depletion of various marine species. In San Felipe, Mexico, guitarfishes in general made up over 22% of elasmobranch bycatch in the industrial teleost trawl fishery. In Costa Rica, this guitarfish is considered to be moderately to highly susceptible to declines from industrial shrimp trawl fishing. There may be some refuge from industrial fishing in the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, but illegal fishing is an ongoing issue there. Overall, due to intense unmanaged fishing pressure throughout most of its rangeÂ and its occurrence in shallow coastal waters (without any refuge from fishing in deeper waters), it is suspected that the Whitesnout Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (18 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",This guitarfish is retained in multi-species fisheries and the meat is dried and sold locally.,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Whitesnout guitarfish,"Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama"
Pseudobatos percellens,Endangered,"The Chola Guitarfish (Pseudobatos percellens) is a small (to 100 cm total length) shark-like ray that occurs patchily in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic Oceans from Quintana Roo, Mexico to ParanÃ¡, Brazil from nearshore to 110 m depth. It is targeted and taken as bycatch in coastal artisanal and commercial trawl, handline, and gillnet fisheries that are intense and unmanaged in parts of its range. For example, it is prevalent in Mexican shrimp trawl fisheries and is the second-most caught species in bycatch. Although data are sparse in Central America and northern South America, fisheries there are intense in some areas and are largely unmanaged. In northern Brazil, unmanaged trawling and gillnetting has led to steep declines and local extinctions of several sharks and rays. Habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development, oil exploration, and pollution are also threats to this species in many parts of its range. There are no population size estimates, however, due to the level of unmanaged and intensifying fishing pressure across its range, the near-disappearance of other elasmobranchs including similar species, and coastal habitat degradation, it is suspected that the Chola Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years), and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.",Meat is sold for use as human food.

Pseudobatos planiceps,Vulnerable,"The Pacific Guitarfish (Pseudobatos planiceps) is a small (to at least 125 cm total length) shark-like ray which occurs from southern Mexico to northern Chile and the GalÃ¡pagosÂ Islands (Ecuador) in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. It inhabits shallow inshore and continental shelf waters to a depth of 50 m. This species is targeted either directly (e.g., in Peru) or as part of multi-species fisheries using gillnet, longline, and beach-seine. It is also a bycatch of large-scale and small-scale shrimp trawl fisheries and small-scale gillnet fisheries and is usually retained for its meat. Fisheries operate throughout most of the range of the species with inadequate management or enforcement and the species has little refuge from fishing activities. It is under particularly heavy fishing pressure in Peru where it is the third most landed ray species. Overall, given the intensity of fishing pressure throughout its range and its susceptibility to capture, it is suspected that the Pacific GuitarfishÂ has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the last three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",This guitarfish is retained and the meat is consumed or sold locally.,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Pacific guitarfish,"Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru"
Pseudobatos prahli,Vulnerable,"The Gorgona Guitarfish (Pseudobatos prahli) is a small (to at least 90 cm total length) shark-like ray that occurs from southern Mexico to northern Peru in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. It inhabits shallow inshore and continental shelf waters to a depth of 70 m. This species is a bycatch of large-scale and small-scale shrimp trawl fisheries and small-scale gillnet and longline fisheries. It is rarely encountered in Mexico and is not common in fisheries in Costa Rica, Colombia, and Peru but is abundant in Ecuador where it may be targeted or is taken as bycatch in small-scale fisheries. Fisheries operate throughout most of the range of the species with inadequate management or enforcement, but the species is associated with rocky habitat which would give it some refuge from trawling. Overall, given the intensity of fishing pressure throughout its range (particularly in Ecuador which appears to be its core range) and itsÂ susceptibilityÂ to capture, it is suspected that the Gorgona GuitarfishÂ has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the last three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.",This guitarfish is retained and the meat is consumed or sold locally.,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Gorgona guitarfish,"Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru"
Pseudobatos productus,Near Threatened,"This is an amended version of the 2014 assessment to accommodate recent taxonomic revision of the genus Rhinobatus.The Shovelnose Guitarfish (Pseudobatos productus) is a medium-sized guitarfish that inhabits shallow coastal waters in the Eastern Central Pacific from central California (USA) to the southern Gulf of California (Mexico). This species is typically found at depths &lt;12 m, but has been recorded to 91.5 m. This guitarfish has a generation length of 9 years and exhibits an annual reproductive cycle with litters of 1-16 pups.In Mexican waters, this species is taken in directed artisanal elasmobranch fisheries in both the Gulf of California and on the Pacific coast of Baja California, and is also retained as bycatch by demersal trawls and gillnets. This guitarfish is the most heavily targeted batoid in north Pacific Mexico. Catches of the BahÃ­a Almejas fishery in Baja California Sur declined severely following a large increase in effort during the mid- to late 1990s.Â In Californian waters, recreational fishing derby data from Elkhorn Slough, central CaliforniaÂ suggest that this species has declined by 74% over three generations.Â Landings in California have also declined, although these declines do not necessarily correspond to population declines.Â In 2012, an annual seasonal closure on elasmobranchÂ fishing was implemented from May 1 to July 31 along the Mexican Pacific coast, and other recent monitoring and management changes have been made in Mexico.Â Nonetheless, given ongoing target and bycatch fisheries for this species in Mexico, an absence of species-specific data in Mexican logbooks, and recreational fishing derbies in the United States, the Shovelnose Guitarfish is is assessed as Near Threatened, as we suspect that this species has declined by nearly 30% over the past three generations.",This species is utilized for its meat and fins.,SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Shovelnose guitarfish,"Mexico, United States of America"
Rhina ancylostomus,Critically Endangered,"The Bowmouth Guitarfish (Rhina ancylostoma) is a medium-sized (to 270 cm total length) shark-like ray with a wide distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from South Africa to New Caledonia and north to Japan. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 70 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the Bowmouth Guitarfish has litter sizes of 2-11 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years.Â The â€˜whiteâ€™ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes)Â are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of the Bowmouth Guitarfish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in the Bowmouth Guitarfish is inferredÂ from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. While some parts of Australasia provide refuge from intense fishing effort, this proportion of the speciesâ€™ range is not considered to be large enough relative to the global range to lower the assessment. It is inferred that the Bowmouth GuitarfishÂ has undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.Â The exception for this species is Australia where wedgefishes are generally not utilized or traded.Â While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.Â The meat is of good quality and a food source for many coastal communities in tropical countries where it is generally consumed locally, although it also enters the international trade in dried and salted form (e.g., Moore 2017, Jabado 2018). Large whole wedgefishes (&gt;200 cm total length; TL) have been traded for a high value of up to US$680 each, however, smaller specimens, and even large Bowmouth Guitarfish (&gt;150 cm TL) can sell for low valueÂ (e.g. Jabado 2018). The â€˜whiteâ€™ fins of shark-like rays (including wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes)Â are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade (Suzuki 2002, Dent and Clarke 2015, Moore 2017). Fin prices in the literature include US$396/kg for wedgefish fins (Chen 1996) and an average price of US$276/kg and US$185/kg for Qun chi (fins from shark-like rays) in Guangzhou (mainland China) and Hong Kong, respectively (HauÂ et al. 2018). The skin may be dried and traded internationally as a luxury leather product (Haque et al. 2018). The eggs of shark-like raysÂ are sometimes dried and consumed locally while the heads may also be dried and used as either fish meal or fertilizer (Haque et al. 2018, R.W.

Rhincodon typus,Endangered,"The Whale Shark (Rhincodon typus) is a large (to 18â€“20 m total length) shark that occurs across tropical and warm temperate oceans. This highly mobile species is found in coastal and oceanic habitats to a depth of at least 1,928 m. Genetic results indicate that two major subpopulations exist, in the Atlantic Ocean and Indo-Pacific, respectively. Pronounced size- and sex-based segregation is present in most of the speciesâ€™ known feeding and transit areas, with coastal sites typically dominated by juvenile male sharks. The largest known aggregation sites for Whale Sharks host hundreds or low thousands of individuals, based on identified individual sharks and model estimates. Although individual sharks are highly mobile, many show a degree of site fidelity, and limited direct connectivity has been observed across large geographical scales.Â Major contemporary threats at the global level include incidental catch in a wide range of net fisheries and serious injury and inferred mortality through vessel strikes. If landed, the meat is consumed locally and the fins are likely to enter international trade. Target and incidental catch fisheries have impacted Whale Sharks in the Indo-Pacific, and there is substantial evidence for a reduction of large adult sharks, decreases in catch-per-unit-effort from fisheries, and declining sightings-per-unit-effort from fisheries and sight-resight studies. While a number of commercial fisheries for the species closed during the 1990â€“2000s, the species still faces a significant level of threat. Based on count data, modelled population estimates and habitat availability, 75% of the global Whale Shark population is inferred to occur in the Indo-Pacific, and 25% in the Atlantic. An overall decline of &gt;65% is inferred in the Indo-Pacific over the last 120 years (three generations), resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Endangered. In the Atlantic Ocean, the overall population decline is considered to be lower at â‰¥30%, resulting in a subpopulation assessment of Vulnerable. Given the bulk of the global population occurs in the Indo-Pacific, based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation,Â a population reduction of 50â€“79% was inferred over the last three generations (120 years).Â Therefore, the species is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","Historically, Whale Sharks have been subject to target fisheries driven by, in some areas, local consumption and use, and the international trade of derivative products. Animals incidentally caught are often utilized, and some national and international trade occurs. Whale Sharks are also a focal species for wildlife tourism industries in many countries.Atlantic OceanOccasional Whale Shark catches have occurred in the Atlantic Ocean since at least 1912 (Gudger 1941). A targeted fishery was present in Santa Cruz, Cuba, where 8â€“9 sharks were caught each year until the fishery was banned in 1991 (Graham 2007). In Venezuela, two Whale Sharks were reportedly harpooned by fishers prior to 1976 (Romero et al. 2000), and up to 21 sharks were opportunistically caught between 2014â€“2017 and their fins sold (SÃ¡nchez et al. 2020). Following targeted conservation efforts between 2018â€“2020, no further retention was reported from this fishery (SÃ¡nchez et al. 2020). There are no other records of targeted catches of Whale Sharks or trade from this subpopulation.Indo-PacificExtensive use and trade have occurred in the Indo-Pacific region. Here, Whale Sharks have been caught commercially in fisheries since at least the 1850s (Gudger 1941), including for the international export of their fins (e.g., from India to China; Bean 1907). However, before the 1980s, they were rarely targeted (Silas 1986, Hsu et al. 2012, Acebes 2013), but rather harpooned opportunistically or landed as incidental catch. Whale Shark muscle tissue has a high water content and has generally been considered unpalatable, or at least of low value, across much of their distribution (Silas 1986, Colman 1997, Acebes 2013). The liver was the primary reason for catches being landed in many areas, as the liver oil could be used as a preservative for the timber used in boat hulls (Silas 1986, Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Hanfee 2001, Akhilesh et al. 2013). Some Whale Sharks were taken specifically for their liver in India as early as 1955â€“1960 (Hanfee 2001). Fishers in the Maldives used to take 20â€“30 individuals per year for their oil, but reported declining catches during the 1980s to early 1990s (Anderson and Ahmed 1993), and the fishery was banned in 1995. Occasional hunting may have continued following protection (Riley et al. 2009).Â Prior to 1985, there was little demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan, although the species was caught regularly as incidental catch in set-net fisheries (Chen et al. 1997). Specimens of several tons in weight sold at US$200â€“300 (Chen and Phipps 2002). A meat fishery developed during the 1990s, with annual catches accelerating to 272 individuals in 1996, derived from both set-net and harpoon fisheries. Whale Shark became the most expensive shark meat available in Taiwan by 1997, reaching prices of US$13.93/kg. A small 2 tonne (t) Whale Shark could by then fetch US$14,000, with a larger 10 t shark selling for around US$70,000 in 1997 (Chen et al. 1997). Catches declined from this peak to 80â€“100 sharks throughout the country each year after 1997 (Hsu et al. 2012). The annual volume of Whale Shark meat traded more than doubled between 1998 and 2000, however, to 60 t in 2000 (Chen and Phipps 2002). Market surveys in 2001 indicated that catches were being under-reported in official statistics and that significant quantities of Whale Shark meat were also being imported through unofficial channels (Chen and Phipps 2002). Following the introduction of specific export codes for Whale Shark meat in 2001, no imports and 2 t of exports were recorded over the following yearâ€”mostly to Spain, and valued at US$1.15/kg (Chen and Phipps 2002). Concern for the status of the species led to total allowable catch quotas being steadily reduced down to zero sharks over the 2001â€“2007 period (Hsu et al. 2012). A total of 693 sharks were caught in Taiwan between 2001 and 2008 (Hsu et al. 2012). Whale Sharks are still regularly encountered in Taiwanâ€™s set net fisheries but, since 2007, they have been released by fishers once caught due to comprehensive fishing bans (Hsu et al. 2012).Â The increase in value and demand for Whale Shark meat in Taiwan led to buyers seeking international suppliers (Hanfee 2001, Chen and Phipps 2002, Acebes 2013). In the Bohol Sea of the Philippines, this led to former marine mammal hunters switching to Whale Sharks, and the improved profit enabled boat owners to invest in larger, faster vessels (Acebes 2013). From 1990 to 1997, 624â€“627 Whale Sharks were caught from four of the primary fishing sites in the Philippines (Alava and DolumbalÃ³ 2002). When Whale Sharks were protected in the Maldives and the Philippines in 1998, Indian exporters realised that Whale Shark exports could prove lucrative and encouraged more fishers there to start targeting the species (Hanfee 2001). Between 1889 and 1998, 1,974 Whale Sharks were recorded as landed in India (Pravin 2000). Surveys in Gujarat from 1999 to 2000 recorded about 600 Whale Sharks landed, with some additional reports received following the cessation of on-site catch monitoring (Hanfee 2001). Following a conservation campaign, Whale Sharks were legally protected in Indian territorial waters in 2001 (Akhilesh et al. 2013). However, landings of Whale Sharks are still documented across India, especially on the coast Andhra Pradesh (e.g., Sathiyaselvam et al. 2016), and in many cases derivative products such as meat are utilised by coastal communities. Similarly, in Pakistan, commercial fisheries for Whale Shark were closed in the 1970s. However, if landed, animals are consumed locally or used as raw material for fishmeal, while fins enter the international trade (Moazzam Khan pers. comm. 03/06/2025).Whale Shark meat from mainland China was historically likely also exported to the Taiwanese market (Chen and Phipps 2002). Though Whale Sharks were not necessarily targeted off mainland China, there was a large incidental catch, estimated at more than 1,000 individuals per annum, due to the intense fishing pressure of the Chinese fleet (Li et al. 2012). Whale Sharks were considered to be a high-value catch in the fishery (Li et al. 2012). An NGO exposÃ© on the ""planet's biggest slaughter of Whale Sharks"" at Puqi markets in Zhejiang province, reported that at least 600 Whale Sharks were processed per year based on investigations from 2010 to 2013 (WildLifeRisk 2014). After the meat, the most profitable product was liver oil, which was extracted for use in cosmetics and health supplements (WildLifeRisk 2014). Whale Shark filter pads also have commercial value in Chinese trade, likely as a substitution for mobulid ray gill plates (O'Malley et al. 2017, Steinke et al. 2017). Reports from Puqi, which remains the most important processing hub for sharks in China, suggest that the scale of the shark fishing industry overall has substantially contracted in recent years (Wu 2016). This may indicate a decline in the number of Whale Sharks being caught, although small quantities of Whale Shark products have been reported from Chinese trade surveys (O'Malley et al. 2017, Steinke et al. 2017). The current status of the Chinese Whale Shark fishery is unclear.Whale Shark fins can also have high trade value (McClenachan et al. 2016). While international trade in Whale Shark fins has taken place for well over a century (Bean 1907), they were regarded as low value in Taiwan in the 1990s due to poor quality and the difficulty of their preparation (Chen and Phipps 2002). Demand for Whale Shark fins within the broader shark fin trade was minimal, despite sometimes being sold as display fins for shark fin soup restaurants (Chen and Phipps 2002). A survey of the Indian fishery, however, found that the fins were a high-value export product to Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Taiwan, and the USA; fishers were paid up to US$1,100 per set of fins in 1999 (Hanfee 2001). Chinese surveys found that Whale Shark fins obtained high prices (Li et al. 2012, WildLifeRisk 2014). Occasional reports of Whale Shark fins and meat being taken in various countries, including Bangladesh (Haque et al. 2019), off Ecuador (Bonaccorso et al. 2021), the Maldives (Riley et al. 2009), Indonesia (White and Cavanagh 2007), and Venezuela (SÃ¡nchez et al. 2020), and their occasional presence in trade surveys (O'Malley et al. 2017, Steinke et al. 2017), indicate that some international trade may persist, though domestic use for catches cannot be ruled out in some of these cases.After starting at Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia in the 1980s, tourism industries based on swimming with or viewing Whale Sharks have now developed at 27 wild sites in 19 countries or territories, as well as eight sites where Whale Sharks are provisioned, and multiple aquarium exhibits (Ziegler and Dearden 2021). For example, in the Philippines, there are at least three provisioning sites in southern Bohol developed in 2019â€“2024, hosting 1â€“15 individuals daily, and in northern Mindanao Whale Sharks are seasonally encountered (Novemberâ€“May) in Macajalar, Gingoog and Butuan bays (Alava and DolumbalÃ³ 2002, Eckert et al. 2002, Araujo et al. 2018). Excluding aquaria, sites around the world attract around 980,000 people, with an economic value of more than US$139 million in 2019 (Ziegler and Dearden 2021).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Whale Shark,"American Samoa, Angola, Anguilla (United Kingdom), Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Bermuda (United Kingdom), Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Brazil, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Brunei Darussalam, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cayman Islands (United Kingdom), Chile, China, Christmas Island, Clipperton, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Colombia, Comoros, Congo, Cook Islands, Costa Rica, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Cuba, CuraÃ§ao, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Fiji, France, French Guiana [FR], French Polynesia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guam, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, SAR, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Israel, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Liberia, Macao, SAR, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Martinique, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mayotte, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Montserrat (United Kingdom), Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Netherlands Antilles, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands (United Kingdom), Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Republic of Korea, RÃ©union, Saint-BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Helena and Dependencies (United Kingdom), Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Taiwan, Province of China, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands (United Kingdom), Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates, United Republic of Tanzania, United States Minor Outlying Islands, United States of America, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, Virgin Islands of the USA, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Western Sahara, Yemen"
Rhinobatos albomaculatus,Critically Endangered,"The Whitespotted Guitarfish (Rhinobatos albomaculatus) is a small (to 80 cm total length) guitarfish that occurs in the Eastern Central Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola. It is demersal on the inner and outer continental shelf to a depth of 132 m. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally dried or dried and smoked while the fins likely enter the international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, and it has become increasingly rare across its range,Â except for some records from countries where fishing pressure is lower (Gabon and Cameroon). Severe population reduction is suspected from actual levels of exploitation, as well as severalÂ historical accounts and contemporary datasets for landings and catch ratesÂ for sharks and rays in the region indicating landings declines of &gt;90% consistent with population reductions of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (24 years).

It is also dried or dried and smoked and exported across West Africa to supply countries such as Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. Fins are dried and appear to mostly be destined to Asian markets through complex regional trade routes (e.g., from Cameroon to Nigeria and then exported to Asia (A.

It is likely demersal on the insular shelves and its depth is unknown, but like other guitarfishes, is presumably less than 100 m. The species is mainly taken as retained bycatch of industrial and artisanal demersal trawls and gillnets and the meat is consumed locally, and fins of larger individuals are possibly traded. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well landings declines of rays of 60â€“88% consistent with population reductions of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (27 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region.

Rhinobatos holcorhynchus,Data Deficient,"The Slender Guitarfish (Rhinobatos holcorhynchus) is a small (to 127 cm total length) demersal shark-like ray that inhabits continental shelf waters in the Western Indian Ocean from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to Kenya at depths of 75â€“350 m. This species is landed as retained bycatch in trawl and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. Guitarfishes are often targeted for their meat and fins in various artisanal fisheries, and are susceptible to being caught. There are no population size estimates for this species, but it is suspected to be declining due to fisheries exploitation. The level of fisheries mortality is unclear in parts of its range, and it may have refuge at depth in some areas.

Rhinobatos hynnicephalus,Endangered,"The Ringed Guitarfish (Rhinobatos hynnicephalus) is a small (to 100 cm total length) shark-like ray endemic to the Northwest Pacific from Japan to Viet Nam. It is demersal in shallow coastal and continental shelf waters at depths of 20â€“100 m. The species has limited biological productivity with small litter sizes of 2â€“9 pups and an estimated generation length of 10 years. The species is captured in industrial, artisanal, and subsistence fisheries with multiple gears, including trawl, gillnet, and longline, and is retained for the meat and fins. The â€˜whiteâ€™ fins of shark-like rays (including guitarfishes)Â are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. However, the fins of this species are likely of lower value due to their small size and while they are known to be consumed domestically in Taiwan and China, they are not currently reported in international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use across the range of the Ringed Guitarfish. Landings data of all skates combined from the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and reconstructed catches of all sharks, skates, and rays from the Japan, China, and South Korea EEZs indicate declines of 40â€“90% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. Severe reductions of guitarfishes have occurred elsewhere in the Indo-West Pacific due to fishing pressure. The Ringed Guitarfish is subject to intense fishing pressure across its entire spatial and depth range and there is serious concern for its ability to sustain historic and current levels of fishing pressure. Although the observed landings of Ringed Guitarfish are considered stable over the past 17 years inÂ Taiwan, this represents a relatively minor part of its range, and there is no concurrent effort data from the observed area to infer population trends. Seasonal fishing bans and inshore trawl bans in China and Taiwan respectively, may afford the species some refuge from fishing pressure. Dramatic levels of habitat loss across its China and South Korea range are also likely a threat to the species. It is inferred that the Ringed Guitarfish has undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (30 years) due to levels of exploitation and a decline in quality of habitat, and it is assessed as Endangered A2cd.Â ","This species is used for the meat, fins, cartilage, and skin. In Taiwan, the meat is of relatively low value at US$2/kg and considered lower quality than the meat of wedgefish. Individuals too small for human consumption are used for fish meal in Taiwan, and likely China (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019).

The species is mainly taken as retained bycatch of industrial and artisanal trammel nets, gillnets, and longlines and the meat is consumed locally and fins of larger individuals are possibly traded. There is a moderate level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species. Population reduction is inferred from actual levels of exploitation, as well landings declines of all sharks and rays and for white-spotted guitarfishes that indicate landings declines of 99% over the past three generation lengths (30 years). These levels of decline are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of guitarfish decline in the region. In general, there are not many fish landing sites along the south coast of Java and, hence, there are some areas where there is very low or no fishing pressure that may be refuge or this species.

Rhinobatos punctifer,Near Threatened,"The Spotted Guitarfish (Rhinobatos punctifer) occurs from the northern Red Sea to Sea of Oman andÂ Arabian Gulf/Persian Gulf (hereafter referred to as the 'Gulf') to depths of 70 m. Due to previous misidentification with the Bengal Guitarfish (Rhinobatis annandalei), accurate information on the species is limited. Guitarfish are commonly caught in gillnet, trawl and line fisheries throughout the region, but specific threats to this species are poorly known due to the lack of information on distribution and fisheries data. Declines of several species of inshore guitarfish have been documented within the region and present levels of catches are of concern with fishing pressure increasing.Â Furthermore, the loss and modification of coastal habitats in the Gulf is a significant concern for inshore species such as this. A decline of &lt;30% is suspected across its range due to current levels of fishing, which is ongoing and suspected to result in a future decline over the next three generation periods (2017-2032).

Rhinobatos rhinobatos,Critically Endangered,"The Common Guitarfish (Rhinobatos rhinobatos) is a medium-sized (to 162 cm total length) guitarfish that occurs in the eastern Atlantic, including the Mediterranean Sea, from the southern Bay of Biscay to Angola. It is demersal on the continental shelf to a depth of 180 m. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in a range of industrial and artisanal gears including demersal trawl, longline, and gillnet. The meat is consumed locally and traded regionally as a dried or dried and smoked product, while the fins likely enter the international trade. There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the range of this species, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade.Sharks and rays, including the Common Guitarfish, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the Mediterranean Sea and Eastern Central Atlantic by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. In the Mediterranean Sea,Â where there has been a long history of fisheries exploitation and which is ongoing, the Common Guitarfish was historically abundant throughout the western, central, and eastern regions but is now locally extinct from former areas of its range.Off the Eastern Central Atlantic, large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in these waters. Other guitarfishes and wedgefishes have undergone severe declines (e.g., the Blackchin Guitarfish (Glaucostegus cemiculus)) and fishing pressure in shallow coastal habitats is unlikely to decrease. Severe population declines have been inferred for Indo-West Pacific guitarfishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reductions (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths) for larger guitarfish species are likely to be representative of the situation in the Eastern Central Atlantic. Indeed, specific target fisheries for the Common Guitarfish have existed in several countries for many decades, and severe population reductions have been noted in Mauritania, Senegal, and in other countries.

It inhabits continental shelves from inshore to a depth of 200 m and is a highly productive species that breeds annually and matures early. The species is taken as target and bycatch by industrial and small-scale fisheries with multiple gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline and is retained for the meat and fins; it is one of the most commonly consumed tropical and sub-tropical coastal sharks globally. The population is reported to have increased in northwest Australia over three generation lengths (15 years), and to be both stable over two years and have declined by 99% over the past three generation lengths (15â€“22 years) in two areas of India, respectively. It is inferred to have declined by 67â€“80% in Sri Lanka over the past three generation lengths and inferred to have declined in Southeast Asia. In some other parts of its range, the Milk Shark is reported to have undergone a population increase, possibly due to meso-predator release.

Rhizoprionodon lalandii,Vulnerable,"The Brazilian Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon lalandii) is a small (to 77 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Panama to Santa Catarina state, Brazil. It inhabits the continental shelf at depths of 3â€“149 m. It is captured in intensive artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout most of its geographic range, and is consumed or sold locally. This shark is highly valued and targeted in Venezuela because the meat is featured in many local dishes and has declined due to the absence of management and increasing demand. There has been a &gt;90% decline of this species in artisanal landings since the 1980s in MaranhÃ£o, northwest Brazil, equivalent to a population reduction of &gt;56% over three generation lengths (12 years). In northeast and eastern Brazil, fishers report that this species was abundant there in the 1980s and is now rare in landings. In southern Brazil, catch-per-unit-effort of this shark was stable between 1996 and 2002, but has declined since in SÃ£o Paulo state. Overall, due to the presence of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries across its range, the lack of a refuge at depth, and inferred declines in artisanal landings throughout its range, to some degree offset by its productive life history, it is suspected that the Brazilian Sharpnose SharkÂ has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generations (12 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bd.","This shark is utilized as food where caught in artisanal fisheries. In Colombia and Venezuela, the meat is highly valued and is used frequently in local traditional dishes (Caldas et al. 2009, Tagliafico et al. 2015).

Rhizoprionodon longurio,Vulnerable,"The Pacific Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon longurio) is a small (to 110 cm total length) requiem shark that occurs in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific from southern California, USA, to Peru from inshore to 100 m depth. This shark is captured as bycatch in demersal shrimp and hake trawl fisheries and in teleost traps, and is targeted by artisanal gillnets and longlines throughout much of its range. These fisheries are generally intense in the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific. There is evidence of a population reduction including an increasing rarity of landings and anecdotal evidence from fishers. Gillnet pressure in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is high and has led to declines in pelagic sharks, and smaller coastal sharks are increasingly targeted without management (or inadequate enforcement of regulations). Shrimp trawling is substantial off southwest Baja California Sur and also off Mazatlan, where declines in catches in other species, overcapacity, and poor governance have been highlighted.Â Throughout its Central and South American range, the species is subjected to intense fishing pressure. Recent landings surveys in Costa Rica have recorded relatively few individuals, and anecdotal evidence from fishers indicates that they were previously much more common.Â In Colombia, this species is recorded in artisanal fisheries at lower frequency than the 1990s.Â Mangrove habitats, which often serve as nursery areas for coastal sharks such as this, have been degraded with the development of shrimp aquaculture in many areas of the Eastern Central Pacific. Although this species has a relativity high biological productivity, a lack of management and enforcement throughout most of its range precludes sustainability. This shark may have some refuge from fishing in southern California and the relatively remote Pacific coast of Baja California. Overall, due to the level of intense and largely unmanaged fisheries operating in its range, its increasing rarity in some areas, and the degradation of coastal mangrove habitats, balanced with some areas of refuge, it is suspected that the Pacific Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generations (15 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2cd.","This shark is targeted and/or caught as retained bycatch through most of its range.

Rhizoprionodon oligolinx,Near Threatened,"The Grey Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon oligolinx) is a small (to 93 cm total length) shark that occurs across the Indo-Pacific Oceans from the Arabian Seas region to China. It is mainly demersal in tropical littoral, continental, and insular shelves at depths of 0â€“36 m. The species is targeted and caught as bycatch in industrial and small-scale fisheries by multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and line, and is retained for its meat, and to a lesser extent for its fins. The population is suspected to be declining across parts of its range. The species is subject to historic and ongoing intense fishing pressure across its spatial and depth range, however it is a productive species which would increase its resilience to fishing pressure. It is still common in parts of the Arabian Seas and Southeast Asia but has also declined and is now uncommon in other parts of those regions. Another small productive shark species, the Milk Shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus), with a similar spatial and depth range has undergone population declines in parts of that range. It is suspected that the Grey Sharpnose Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20â€“29% over the past three generation lengths (12 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2d.","The Grey Sharpnose Shark is used for its meat which is consumed fresh or dried, and in some countries, such as Oman, Saudi Arabia, and India, the meat is dried and salted for domestic sales or trade with neighbouring countries.

Rhizoprionodon porosus,Vulnerable,"The Caribbean Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon porosus) is a small (to 110 cm total length) coastal shark that occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from the Bahamas, Caribbean Islands, and Quintana Roo, Mexico to Uruguay. It inhabits continental and insular shelves from close inshore to a depth of 500 m. It is targeted and taken as bycatch in gillnet, longline and commercial trawl fisheries, which are intense and inadequately managed in key parts of its range. The meat is typically consumed or sold locally and the fins do appear in the international fin trade.In the Western Central Atlantic, catches are low outside of Belize and Honduras, but there they are among the most-captured species of shark in artisanal bycatch. This shark is captured more often and is often targeted in Atlantic South America, the core of its distribution, where fishing pressure is intense and unmanaged, and has led to notable declines in other larger elasmobranchs. Due to the level of exploitation by widespread artisanal and commercial fisheries which mostly lack adequate management, particularly in the Southwest Atlantic, it is suspected that the Caribbean Sharpnose Shark has undergone an overall population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (14 years), and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","Caribbean Sharpnose Sharks are valued for their meat which is likely to be consumed for subsistence or sold locally in most places.

Rhizoprionodon taylori,Least Concern,"The Australian Sharpnose Shark (Rhizoprionodon taylori) is a small-sized abundant shark (to 88 cm total length) restricted to southern Papua New Guinea and tropical northern Australia. It occupies inshore habitats to a depth of 110 m. It is caught as bycatch in inshore gillnet and trawl fisheries, where the catches are low and sustainable. It is not a targeted species and is one of the fastest-growing and most productive species of shark known; it matures after 1 year with females producing up to 10 pups every year, and it has one of the highest rates of population increase of any shark species. This life history makes it able to sustain higher fishing pressure than most other shark species, especially when the immature portion of the population is not exploited.

Rhynchobatus luebberti,Critically Endangered,"The African Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus luebberti) is a large (to ~300 cm total length) shark-like ray which is widespread off West Africa in the eastern Atlantic from Mauritania to Angola. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf waters from close inshore to depths of at least 35 m. Wedgefishes have limited biological productivity; the African Wedgefish has litter sizes of 2â€“5 pups and an estimated generation length of 15 years. The â€˜whiteâ€™ fins of shark-like rays (including sawfishes, wedgefishes, and giant guitarfishes) are considered the best quality fins for human consumption and are among the highest valued in the international shark fin trade. The meat is of high quality and generally consumed locally. Fishing effort and the number of fishers has increased in recent decades across West Africa, with demand for shark and ray product increasing over the same period due to the shark fin trade. Sharks and rays, including wedgefishes, are often targeted and now heavily exploited across the region by net and trawl fisheries leading to overfishing and the local disappearance of some species. Large regional fishing nations including Mauritania and Senegal have seen significant increases in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in waters off West Africa. Severe population reduction has been inferred for Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes from several datasets, and while similar data are not available for West Africa, the levels of documented population reduction (&gt;90% over the last three generation lengths for larger wedgefish species) could likely be considered representative of the situation in the eastern Atlantic. Indeed, the African Wedgefish was considered to be moderately abundant in the 1960s, but it is now only sporadically observed in landing site surveys.

Rhynchobatus palpebratus,Near Threatened,"The Eyebrow Wedgefish (Rhynchobatus palpebratus) is a medium-sized (to at least 262 cm total length) shark-like ray with an apparently disjunct distribution in the Indo-West Pacific from northern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea (and marginally into Indonesian waters), the Andaman Sea off Thailand, and Taiwan. It occurs in coastal and continental shelf watersÂ at depths of 5-61 m. The taxonomy of the 'whitespotted wedgefish' species-complex (which includes several Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes) is not fully resolved, and the distribution of the Eyebrow Wedgefish may be refined when more information comes to light.

There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across the Asian part of the range of the Eyebrow Wedgefish, and as a result, targeted and incidental fishing effort is placing significant pressure on all wedgefish species in the Indo-West Pacific. Where wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have been targeted or exploited as incidental catch, severe declines, population depletions, and localized disappearances have occurred. Severe population reduction in Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes is inferredÂ from actual levels of exploitation, as well as several historical accounts and contemporary datasets from Iran, Pakistan, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. The Eyebrow Wedgefish is inferred to have undergone a &gt;80% population reduction over the last three generations (45 years) in the Asian part of its range.Â However, the bulk of the species' currently recognized distribution is in areas were fishing pressure is low, and management is in place (i.e., Australia). It is therefore inferred that the Eyebrow Wedgefish has undergone a 20-30% population reduction globally over the last three generations (45 years) and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd. If the species was in fact wider-ranging throughout the Indo-Malay Archipelago/Southeast Asia, as its disjunct distribution suggests, it would likely have undergone population reduction over the last three generations which would be high enough to quality it for a threatened category (possibly as high as Critically Endangered, which is the status of other Indo-West Pacific wedgefishes).","Wedgefishes are heavily utilized across their range for the meat and fins.Â The exception for this species is Australia where wedgefishes are generally not utilized or traded.Â While little species-specific information is available, the following provides a generalized account of use and trade globally.

Habitat and depth range are unknown, but it likely occurs on the sandy shoals, mudflats, and seagrass beds of the Banc dâ€™Arguin.

Mauritania has seen a significant increase in fishing effort since the second half of the 20th Century, with considerable artisanal and industrial fishing fleets operating in its waters. The Indigenous Imraguen population in the north of the country where the False Shark Ray occurs were traditionally subsistence fishers until a shift to commercial shark fishing from the mid-1980s.Â This shift, along with increasing artisanal and industrial fishing effort possibly depleted the False Shark Ray population even before it was formally described in 2016. The False Shark Ray occurs in an area where directly targeting shark has been prohibited since 2003 and where only traditional Indigenous fishers are permitted to fish (the Banc d'Arguin National Park). However, the artisanal fishing effort in the National Park, combined with illegal fishing effort is considerable, and the False Shark Ray is known to be landed locally. Individuals have been observed with their fins removed when landed, and the fins sold to local fin dealers.

It is highly productive with annual large litters of 6â€“20 pups, early maturation at two years and a short generation length of 4.5 years. The species is caught mainly by trawl and gillnet in industrial and artisanal fisheries and is retained for human consumption.

It inhabits the continental shelf from inshore to 100 m depth. It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, and may also be caught in trawl fisheries, all of which are intense and largely unmanaged across much of its range. Although it has always been rare, records have become increasingly so over the decades since the 1950s; it is thought to be locally extinct in the Gulf of California and is overfished further south. There were nine records from all of Mexico between 1978 and 1994 and there have been none since. The situation is somewhat different in Colombia, where the species persists and is caught relatively frequently in artisanal catches. Fishing pressure is high there and it is suspected to have undergone a population reduction, although not as severe as that seen in Mexico. Overall, due to the known sensitivity of hammerhead sharks to overfishing, degradation of mangrove habitats, the level of intense and unmanaged fisheries across its range, its lack of refuge at depth, and the lack of recent records in Mexico (a large proportion of its range) despite fisheries-dependent and -independent surveys, it is inferred that the Scalloped Bonnethead has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (24 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bcd.","This shark is consumed or sold locally when captured (MejÃ­a-Falla et al. 2017) and fins may be traded internationally.

It is captured in commercial and artisanal longlines and gillnets, which are typically unmanaged and operate throughout its range. It may also be caught in trawl fisheries. The declining numbers of records over the past several decades and range contraction in some areas indicates that this shark has undergone population reduction in both the Pacific and the Atlantic. In the Pacific, records have become increasingly rare and this species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Records are sparse from elsewhere in Pacific Mexico and Central America and occur rarely in Colombia and Ecuador. The Atlantic South American portion of the population has also been reduced in size substantially. Off Caribbean Colombia, this species is considered rare.

Sphyrna mokarran,Critically Endangered,"The Great Hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) is a large (to 610 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in tropical and warm temperate seas to depths of 300 m. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic large- and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins. It has a long lifespan of up to 44 years and only breeds once every two years, which combined with high bycatch mortality, makes it susceptible to depletion where it is taken in unmanaged fisheries. The Great Hammerhead appears to have undergone steep declines in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and in the Atlantic prior to management measures, where slow recovery may now be occurring in the Northwest Atlantic. The global population is estimated to have undergone reductions of 50.9â€“62.4%, with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (71.1â€“74.4 years). There is a lack of data from the Pacific, limited regional representation of some time-series, intensive fisheries in data-poor regions that are suspected to have driven significant declines, and uncertainty about levels of exploitation that are potentially similar to those of the Scalloped Hammerhead (S. lewini) (which has been assessed as globally Critically Endangered).

Sphyrna tiburo,Endangered,"The Bonnethead Shark (Sphyrna tiburo)Â is a small (to 150 cm total length) hammerhead shark found in shallow coastal waters in the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean. It is a wide-ranging species inhabiting continental and insular shelves over mud and sand, seagrass, coral reefs, estuaries, shallow bays and channels from inshore to 90 m deep. The Bonnethead SharkÂ is likely a species complex, with three distinct elements:Â the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (United States of America (USA), Bahamas, and Mexico), the Caribbean Sea and Southwest AtlanticÂ (Belize south to Brazil, including Panama and Trinidad and Tobago), and theÂ Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific.Â The species has among the highest population growth rates calculated for sharks, making it much less sensitive to fishing mortality than most other species of sharks. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal gillnet and longline fisheries and as bycatch in shrimp fisheries. Despite its high productivity, drastic inferred declines have been reported throughout its range. The Northwest and Western Central Atlantic (USA, Bahamas, and Mexico) is stable due to management and in that region is assessed as Near Threatened. The Caribbean Sea and Southwest Atlantic portion of the population has been reduced substantially in size. This shark was commonly encountered in the 1980s off the Caribbean Colombia, but is now very rare. In Brazil, this species was assessed regionally as Extinct off the state of Rio de Janeiro, collapsed in SÃ£o Paulo, and Vulnerable in EspÃ­rito Santo State due to overfishing. There have been very sparse records of this species in Bahia state, and fishers describe this species as being depleted and the species in that region is assessed as Critically Endangered. In the Eastern Central and Southeast Pacific, this species was formerly abundant in the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Mexico. Artisanal fisheries shifted to targeting smaller coastal sharks, including Bonnethead Shark, in the 1990s. Records of this species became increasingly rare since the 1980s, and the species is no longer present in the Gulf of California. Despite extensive landings surveys, fishery-independent research surveys, and research on museum specimens, the last record in Mexico was in 2006 in Oaxaca. This shark has not been encountered in Central America since the 1980s. Its recent absence from large parts of its range in Central and South America and rarity of recent records across this part of its range infer that this species has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (36 years) and it is assessed in that region as Critically Endangered. Overall, the combination of low fishing mortality in throughout the USA, declines in Atlantic Central America, combined with widespread disappearance in Southwest Atlantic and Pacific this species is inferred to have undergone a population reduction of 50â€“79% over the past three generation lengths (36 years) due to actual and potential levels of fishing and habitat loss and degradation due to coastal development and shrimp aquaculture, and hence it is assessed as Endangered A2bcd.Â ","Bonnethead Shark are utilised for their meat and fins. Meat is consumed or sold locally and the fins are traded internationally (CardeÃ±osa et al. 2020). Based on trimming of shark fins from Hong Kong in 2014â€“2015, Bonnethead Shark makes up 0.06% of the fin trade (Fields et al. 2018).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,"Bonnethead shark, Shovelhead shark","Anguilla (United Kingdom), Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda (United Kingdom), Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Brazil, British Virgin Islands (United Kingdom), Cabo Verde, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, CuraÃ§ao, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana [FR], Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Montserrat (United Kingdom), Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Saint-BarthÃ©lemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint-Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Virgin Islands of the USA"
Sphyrna tudes,Critically Endangered,"The Smalleye Hammerhead (Sphyrna tudes) is a medium-sized (to 150 cm total length) shark that occurs in the Western Central and Southwest Atlantic from Colombia to the Rio de La Plata, Argentina. It inhabits inshore waters over the continental shelf at depths of 5â€“80 m. It is captured in intense and largely unmanagedÂ commercial and artisanal beach seines, gillnets, longlines, and trawls throughout its geographic range. This shark is targeted or retained as bycatch for its meat, which is consumed or sold locally.Â There are few data on population reduction but these intensive unmanaged fisheries are suspected to have caused reductions and possibly local extinctions throughout this species' range. For example, inÂ Brazil, this hammerhead has not been recorded in 35 years from CearÃ¡ state and it is considered by local fishers to be depleted in Bahia state.Â This shark is supposed to be strictly protected in Brazil, but it is clear that it is still landed and traded in various states.Â Overall, due to intense and largely unmanaged fisheries across its range, lack of refuge at depth, suspected declines in many areas and local extinctions suspected from an absence of records (despite continued sampling and observation), and its relatively unproductive life history, it is suspected that the Smalleye HammerheadÂ has undergone a population reduction of &gt;80% over the past three generations (37 years), and it is assessed as Critically Endangered A2bd.","Hammerheads are among the main shark species in the fin trade and are among the preferred species for shark fin soup. Although other larger congeners are preferred in trade, it is likely that this species also enters the international market, as demand for smaller fins is increasing (CardeÃ±osa et al. 2019). The meat is likely consumed or sold locally, but may also be exported to Brazil where demand is rising (Dent and Clarke 2015).Â In Colombia, it is consumed by Indigenous communities (Puentes-CaÃ±Ã³n et al. 2012).",SPECIES,Appendix II: ,Smalleye hammerhead shark,"Argentina, Aruba, Bonaire, Saint Eustatius and Saba, Brazil, Colombia, CuraÃ§ao, French Guiana [FR], Grenada, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)"
Sphyrna zygaena,Vulnerable,"The Smooth Hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena) is a large (to 400 cm total length) coastal and semi-oceanic pelagic shark, wide-ranging in temperate and tropical seas to depths of at least 200 m, possibly 500 m. Population growth rates of 0.225 per year are among the fastest known for pelagic sharks and the fastest of the hammerhead species. The Smooth Hammerhead is caught globally as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for the fins, and sometimes the meat. It has undergone steep historic declines in the Atlantic but the introduction of management measures may be allowing slow recovery, lesser declines in the South Pacific, and increases in the Indian Ocean. The weighted global population trends estimated a median reduction of 21.8â€“64.8%, with the highest probability of &lt;20% and &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (72.3 years). The Northwest Atlantic data that includes the period after management changes led to the lower estimated global reduction. However, there is uncertainty in some of the catch data, limited regional representation of some time-series, and intensive-fisheries in data-poor regionsÂ that are suspected to have driven declines, balanced with the relatively lower level of artisanal fisheries threat to this species compared to that of the Scalloped Hammerhead (S. lewini) and Great Hammerhead (S. mokarran), due to its generally more temperate distribution. Expert judgement elicitation thus inferred a global population reduction of 30â€“49% and the Smooth Hammerhead is therefore assessed as Vulnerable A2bd. More robust species-specific data and monitoring of catches is required to improve certainty of catch estimates for a future assessment of this species.","The main product from the species that is traded is the fins (CITES 2013). Hammerhead fins are among the main shark species in the fin trade and one of the preferred species for shark fin soup (Clarke et al. 2006a, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields et al. 2018).

Triaenodon obesus,Vulnerable,"The Whitetip Reef Shark (Triaenodon obesus) is a medium-sized (at least 200 cm TL) coastal shark species that inhabits tropical coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean from western Africa to the Eastern Pacific. It occurs from the surface down to depths of at least 330 m. The species exhibits moderately slow life history characteristics. It is caught as target and bycatch through much of its range in industrial and small scale fisheries using longline, gillnet, handline, and trawls, and is often retained for its fins, flesh, skin, teeth. and liver. This species is also threatened by declines in quality of coral reefs due to climate change, destructive fishing practices and poor water quality. Steep declines in population abundance have been reported in some parts of its range, while in others it appears to remain at high abundance. Based on baited remote underwater video station data from 250 reefs in 39 jurisdictions throughout its range the estimated global population reduction is 48.8% over three generation lengths (37 years). Therefore, the Whitetip Reef Shark is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 30â€“49% over the past three generation lengths (37 years) due to levels of exploitation and declines in habitat quality, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2bcd.","The meat of this species is sold fresh, frozen, salted and dried for human consumption at local markets throughout it range.
